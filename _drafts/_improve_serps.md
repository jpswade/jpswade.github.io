title: How can I improve my search engine rankings?
---

We know that backlinks are important to get ranked in Google, but what else can be done to improve our ranking?

[We know that backlinks are still important](http://wade.be/internet/development/2017/05/30/have-backlinks-become-irrelevant.html), but we also know that there's [other ranking signals](https://moz.com/blog/the-myth-of-googles-200-ranking-factors) to think about.

Although search engines are not quite the wild west that they used to be, there's still lots you can do to get the results you want.

If getting backlinks is the objective, then building trust is the goal. So how can we build trust?

## Analytics

You and your developers need to know the SEO implications of what they are working on. Using [Google Webmaster tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/), which is free and invaluable. A tool that is not to be underestimated. It's a looking glass into Google's world.

To make your backlink efforts measurable, you can use tools like [Majestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_Search_Engine) to measure unique linking domains acquired.

There's a whole host of metrics are available to marketers interested in [search engine optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization_metrics).

Google, Moz, Majestic Search Engine and Ahrefs all use their own crawled data to derive at a numeric conclusion on a website's organic search potential.

## Content

To improve your search results, you need to have rich content.

We know that Google wants magazine style websites that can grow exponentially, so create shareable content (eg: Top 10).

Transparency is key to building trust and brand recognition. Displaying facts and figures about the business are likely to gain some trust points with visitors. Where possible, showing business locations on a map on the homepage is a good way to demonstrate that you are a trust worthy bricks and mortar business, not just another fly-by-night operation.

Add images that complement the content and explain ideas. They get people's attention and can be much more efficient than words.

That doesn't mean you should depend on images to display content. Text will make your content accessible and search engine friendly.

Give your visitors what they want. If people come to the website for deals, give them deals. Give them great deals that they will want to share with their friends and on other websites. Ask questions such as: “What do your friends think of this product?” - Share it on Facebook.

Don't worry so much about duplicate content. In 2008, Google’s blog said that duplicate content penalties were a myth. In 2013, Google’s Matt Cutts said “Duplicate Content Won’t Hurt You”. Do follow Google’s advice to avoid duplicate content, but let Google worry about stolen content.

Focus on building TRUST, be authoritative and create new unique rich content.

## Engagement

So, although search engines aren't phasing out backlinks just yet, if you're not present on social media, it may not only harm your ranking but it will actually harm your public image.

Use social media to provide great customer service. Don't just reserve yourself to Facebook and Twitter though, reach out to forums and online groups and engage with your customers.

Tap into existing communities such as such as youtube, reddit, stumbleupon, forums and blogs.

Do press releases. Let people know what you're up to.

Manage your brand on external sites such as reviews and rating websites and ensure your business is listed and correct in Google places/business.

## Security

Security builds TRUST.

Google has had default https access for Gmail since 2010, Facebook has had secure browsing by default since 2013, HTTPS has been a ranking signal since August 2014.

Going secure by default has already happened.

As of November 2015, "Let’s Encrypt" is offering [free SSL certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/). There's no excuses.

## Reliability

You don't need to focus on speed too much, but you do want to make sure your hosting is reliable.

Do checkout Google's page speed tips, but be aware that they will only get you some of the way.

If you want to build an enterprise, you need to build a bigger, faster, more reliable website by implementing a scalable infrastructure.

Cache everything (think CDN and memcache), if you can cache it, cache it.

Focus on the perception of performance from users rather than speed tests.

## User experience

> “I was shocked to realise how dependent I’ve grown on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.”

An elegant and modern design is perceived as more trustworthy. Make it clear and easily accessible.

The aim is to have brutally simple web pages consisting of key elements.

Use Image Sliders and Carousels sparingly (take Amazon’s lead on this)

Avoid lightboxes - “Interactions that happen through modal dialogs or across modules/panels on large screens often make more sense as separate pages on smaller screens.”

Avoid infinite scrolling, people tend to hate endlessly scrolling through results

Price sliders rarely work well, use price ranges (See Amazon)

> “Don’t break the back button”, JAKOB NIELSEN, May 30, 1999.

Focus on elegant, modern design.

Very clear and easily accessible navigation.

The home page should be visually clear and provide easy access to the website's main purposes or functions.

Employ a clean, elegant, modern design. Have very clear and easily accessible navigation.

The home page should be visually clear and provide easy access to the website's main purposes or functions.

Pictures are faster than words.

Use pictures to explain ideas. They get people's attention and can be much more efficient than words.

Grid lists are best suited for showing data sets that represent themselves through images.

Fluid grids and media query adjustments, responsive design enables page layouts to adapt to a variety of screen sizes.

The design should be: Focused, Modern, Accommodating, Appealing, Adaptive.

## Summary

You don't need to worry about what people say.
