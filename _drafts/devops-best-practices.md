DevOps started out as "[Agile Systems Administration](https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/05/16/devops-name/)". In 2008, [Andrew Shafer](https://twitter.com/littleidea) did a talk called ["Agile Infrastucture"](http://www.jedi.be/blog/2008/10/09/agile-2008-toronto-agile-infrastructure-and-operations-presentation/) addressing issues around involving more of the company in the same disciplines as programmers.

In 2009, [Patrick Debois](https://twitter.com/patrickdebois) created "DevOpsDays" conference to help to bring it to light. However, it wouldn't begin to [trend until about 2010](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=all&q=devops), when people would begin to describe it as a [standalone discipline](http://www.somic.org/2010/03/02/the-rise-of-devops/).

Today, DevOps goes beyond just developers, systems administration and infrastructure, its about [dev, ops, agile, cloud, open source and business](https://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2010/03/03/devops-mixing-dev-ops-agile-cloud-open-source-and-business/), everything.

DevOps is a movement. There's no certificate, role, set of tools or prescriptive process. There's no specification, it's not a product, or job title. There's no one true voice on what DevOps is or isn't. It's about attitude, ideas, customs and behaviours. Culture, paradigms and philosophy. It's a way of thinking, a way of doing and a way of being. Practicing as well as preaching. It's a conversation. It's about taking the best experiences and sharing those with others.

There are some very important qualities, approaches and techniques that have proven to work, that everyone should be aware of, they are the best practices.
 
Let's explore those...

- ["cattle rather than pets"](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/18/servers_pets_or_cattle_cern/) - the paradigm of disposable server infrastructure.
- [Achieving 10 deployments per day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4) - the story of how Flickr adopted DevOps.
- [Culture](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html) - There's [t-shirts](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/devops+t-shirts), [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebIr4F-vjQ), [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYLxw6OsZug), [podcasts](http://devopscafe.org/), [books](https://medium.com/devopslinks/10-great-books-for-aspiring-devops-sre-engineers-76536c7c4909). DevOps is as much about preaching as it is practicing.
- [No silos](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/separate-devops-team) - Cross-functional teams and T-shaped people, an attitude of shared responsibility is an aspect of DevOps culture that encourages closer [collaboration](https://blog.chef.io/2017/03/01/devops-is-all-about-collaboration/).
- [Version control](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/a-devops6/index.html), all code should be under version control, allowing for code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
- [Continuous Integration](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousIntegrationCertification.html) - When the build fails, it’s usually back to green within ten minutes.
- [Products not projects](https://www.madetech.com/blog/products-not-projects) - Delivery teams run software products, not projects, that run from inception to retirement.
- [Deployment Pipelines](https://continuousdelivery.com/implementing/patterns/) - Get humans out of the deployment business.
- [Key Performance Indicators](https://www.atlassian.com/devops#measurement) - Management thinker Peter Drucker is often quoted as saying that "you can't improve what you can't measure".
- [Release early, release often](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html) - Until code is in production, no value is actually being generated.
- [Feature Toggles](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) rather than feature branches, avoiding merge hell and more control over features and deployments.
- [Trunk based Development](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines) ([Moonpig](https://engineering.moonpig.com/development/move-to-trunk-based-development-without-the-chaos))
