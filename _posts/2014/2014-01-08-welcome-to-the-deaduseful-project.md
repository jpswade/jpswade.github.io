<p class="lead">
  Well, it's finally here.
</p>

It's been a long time coming but we've finally transitioned to The DeadUseful Project.

The DeadUseful Project is anÂ amalgamation of some useful tools I created for myself, but then developed them for others over a few years.

My goal for this project is to keep my creativity alive and continue to develop my skills, while putting existing projects to work to earn a passive income.

Well, that's all for now, but watch out for the new tools.
