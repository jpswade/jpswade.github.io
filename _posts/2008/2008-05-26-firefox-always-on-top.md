  When watching long streaming online videos I often watch them while I do other things, perhaps even browse other websites. I need something to keep firefox on top!
</p>

The problem is the moment that I use another application the focus is taken away from the Firefox window and it goes into the background. This is no good as I can no longer see the video.

I decided to investigate a solution that could keep the Mozilla Firefox window &#8220;Always on Top&#8221;&#8230;

Like most people my first port of call was the Mozilla Firefox community, I made a post called &#8220;[Always on top](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2810517)&#8220;, which asked if there was javascript or a plugin somewhere that can force the window to always be on top.

I quickly discovered that there wasn't going to be any kind of easy way to achieve this using Firefox alone.

What I needed was a third party application, ideally something freeware, or even better open source.

Here's a short list of what I found:

  * [Actual Window Manager](http://www.actualtools.com/windowmanager/) &#8211; $49.95 
      * Seems rather expensive for something that should be free.
  * [Keep On Top](http://www.delayedreaction.com/freestuff/index.html) &#8211; Freeware 
      * Very basic, doesn't really offer anything special
  * [AbstractPath PowerMenu](http://www.abstractpath.com/powermenu/) &#8211; Freeware 
      * Gives you context menus that offer: Always On Top, Transparency and Minimize To Tray.
  * [RBTray](http://rbtray.sourceforge.net/) &#8211; Open Source 
      * Offers the context menus: My Size, Always On Top, and Minimize To Tray
  * [WinPin](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/DLL/WinPin.aspx) &#8211; Open Source 
      * Gives you a little pin to the left of your &#8220;Minimise&#8221; button that will &#8220;pin&#8221; the window on top.

All in all, I'd say WinPin does the job just fine, if you also want to Minimise to Tray too, try RBTray.
