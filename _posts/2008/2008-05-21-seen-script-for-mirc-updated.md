  Looking for someone? huh? Well, look no further, this script is designed to keep log of people quiting, parting, being kicked out of and changing their nick&#8230; It also tells you if they are still on IRC, on a different channel or such, its basically the easiest way to keep track of people. It can now also tell you when someone last spoke.
</p>
