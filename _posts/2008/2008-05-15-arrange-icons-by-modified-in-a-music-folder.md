  Windows XP often does some really annoying things, such as automatically customising a folder, changing it's kind into &#8220;music&#8221;, when it detects that the folder contains music files.
</p>

Although for some people this might be useful, for me it's not. Often I'll want to sort the files in a folder by different fields, NOT the ones that music folders have.

Easy, I thought, it's just a case of changing the folder customisation kind back to &#8220;Document&#8221;. Wrong.

Here you can see the default &#8220;Arrange Icons By&#8221; menu, that comes with a &#8220;music&#8221; folder&#8230;](http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-folder.jpg) 

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-196" title="arrange_icons_by-folder" src="http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-folder-300x267.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="267" />](http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-folder.jpg) 

But we don't want this, we want our standard fields back!

In Explorer, go to View -> &#8220;Choose Details&#8221;.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-197" title="arrange_icons_by-view-menu" src="http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-view-menu.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="286" />](http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-view-menu.jpg) 

A dialogue will appear&#8230;

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-198" title="arrange_icons_by-choose-details" src="http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-choose-details-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" />](http://wade.be/upload/arrange_icons_by-choose-details.jpg) 

From here we can choose date modified, and various other &#8220;details&#8221; or &#8220;fields&#8221; that we'd like to &#8220;arrange icons by&#8221;.

Enjoy!
