  Yes, my botnet is pretty lame, but it&#8217;s also kinda cool. I&#8217;m not talking about anything bad though.
</p>

My botnet is an [eggdrop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggdrop) botnet that I use on the [EFnet](http://www.efnet.org/) [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) network and it runs a script I called &#8220;lame&#8221;.

The script my botnet uses written in [tcl](http://www.tcl.tk/) was originally created by unknownd, but has since stopped development.

I know that he stopped development because not only did I speak to him before he quit IRC, but [all](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://unknownd.daer.net/) [his](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://home.no.net/unknownd/) [sites](http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.unknownd.net) are no longer available.

The script was originally called &#8220;[harry.tcl](http://www.google.com/search?q=harry.tcl)&#8220;, but it had a [few bugs](http://forum.egghelp.org/viewtopic.php?p=80267), so I decided to fix them and call it lame.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a fantastic script, but what I had was pretty lame, as it was just a hacked up version of someone else&#8217;s script but I only used it for my own personal botnet, so it didn&#8217;t really matter.

However, I now realise that it is actually better than the original _harry.tcl_ because of the bugs I have fixed and the tweaks I added.

A few people over the years have shown a little interest in my botnet script, so I think it&#8217;s about time that I released it.

_So where do I get the goodies?_

I&#8217;ve setup a project hosting on Google Code as &#8220;[lamebotnet](http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/)&#8220;.

There&#8217;s no &#8220;release&#8221; as such yet, but you can get the files you need [here](http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/), you only need to really follow the instructions in the [readme](http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/readme.txt) file.

Don&#8217;t forget to configure your &#8220;[botnet](http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/botnet)&#8221; file, otherwise your bots won&#8217;t know where to connect.

I am aware that by releasing the script I may make myself more vulnerable to exploitation and people may [point out issues or bugs](http://code.google.com/p/lamebotnet/issues/list) I wasn&#8217;t aware of, but hey, I&#8217;m all for improvement and look forward to fixing them.

Of course, this is assuming there even are any issues, there may not be, I&#8217;ve run this since about 2001 and had no major issues yet, so my hopes are pretty high.

Enjoy!

_PS. Think of your own naming scheme for your botnet, I&#8217;m already using the muppets!_
