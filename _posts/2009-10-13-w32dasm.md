<p class="lead">
  W32Dasm (or Win32DASM) doesn&#8217;t seem to exist on the map any more, but it&#8217;s still a very useful programmers tool, especially if you like reverse engineering.
</p>

W32Dasm is a Windows 32-bit (Win32) [disassembler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler). What it does is display the programs routines in assembly code, which makes it easier for you to trace what the software is doing.

I like to use this software every once in a while, but recently I found there were no decent sources for this software.

<!--more-->However, I soon located a copy that I had on my computer from a while back, in a directory named &#8220;w32ds893&#8221;.

The help file details a website which appears to be down, but there is an archived version.

  * [http://www.expage.com/page/w32dasm](http://web.archive.org/web/20020203211452/http://www.expage.com/page/w32dasm)

This takes you to another now defunct site, which is also archived:

  * [members.home.net/w32dasm/](http://web.archive.org/web/20020204180925/http://members.home.net/w32dasm/)

As you can see from that page you can download w32dasm v8.7 as w32ds87.zip, but not the latest version.

Below you will find &#8220;w32ds893.zip&#8221; which contains &#8220;**W32DSM89.EXE**&#8220;, which is the latest known version:

  * [w32ds893.zip](http://www.2shared.com/file/z9Fweb8q/w32ds893.html) (2shared)
  * [w32ds893.zip](http://www.4shared.com/file/118537627/1ebea2e3/w32ds893.html) (4shared)
  * [w32ds893.zip](http://www.multiupload.com/R8UCFWH954) (MultiUpload)
  * [w32ds893.zip](http://web.archive.org/web/20140418115149/http://www.sotzone.ru/cybersmoke/files/other/w32ds893.zip) (sotzone.ru via archive.org)
  * [w32ds893.zip](http://www.sotzone.ru.nyud.net:8080/cybersmoke/files/other/w32ds893.zip) (sotzone.ru via nyud.net)
  * [w32ds893.zip](http://www.sotzone.ru/cybersmoke/files/other/w32ds893.zip) (sotzone.ru direct link)

Original sourced is unknown but works fine.

  * [w32ds893.zip in VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d8cdee0dd43196b86fc3fb9ab777e1ac370aed0eeacc61d938457142518be9f4/analysis/) 
      * You can safely ignore the TROJ_GEN.FCBHZJ1 as it is a false positive due to the nature of the software.

If you&#8217;re not comfortable using this, try [OllyDbg or a similar alternative](http://alternativeto.net/software/ollydbg/).
