<p class="lead">
  Many years back I began investigating anti email spam in the UK as a way to defend against the amount amount of email spam we were receiving to certain email addresses.
</p>

The reason this email address was getting so much spam is because it was harvested by a website spider bot, as the email address was placed on company website by the previous webmaster.<!--more-->

  DO NOT put your email address or any email addresses directly on your website, instead use a form.
</p>

Back then there was only examples of support for US, but very little support in the UK.

One thing I did find was the [Office Of Fair Trading Spam Tips](http://www.oft.gov.uk/Consumer/Spam/default.htm) but they were not very useful, the JunkBusters.com website has some nice tips on &#8220;[junk email](http://web.archive.org/web/20091027232014/http://www.junkbusters.com/junkemail.html)&#8220;, if only something existed like this for the UK.

I discovered that in the US you can send your junk/spam email to <spam@ftc.gov> and they will pursue law enforcement actions against people sending the emails.

After I read the [NEW RULES ON EMAIL MARKETING](http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/privacy_and_electronic/introductory/rules_~1.pdf) article, I figured I could issue a complaint with the [Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/privacy_and_electronic_communications.aspx) via [this form](http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Forms/pecr_complaints_form.doc).

**Update:** In 2010 the BBC offered an article entitled: &#8220;[How can I stop getting spam emails?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/stopping-spam-emails)&#8221; which seems to offer sufficient advice, there's also a whole heap of resources in the Dmoz &#8220;[email spam](http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/E-mail/Spam/)&#8221; directory.
