Agile, what’s it all about?

Why does the agile software development exist? What’s it all about? Why do people use it? Who uses it? How do you use it?

It’s about communication and flexibility, delivering business value sooner, breaking work down into manageable chunks and even automated testing.

It’s a way to provide businesses with the discipline and focus needed to maintain agility and sustainably deliver customer value.

“Broadly defined, Agile Project Management is an iterative process that focuses on customer value first, team interaction over tasks, and adapting to current business reality rather than following a prescribed plan” - ThoughtWorks

Agile software development is an approach to software development, and there are others, such as the v-model and waterfall.
Background
The reason why agile has become popular since its inception in 2001 is because one of the major problems with the traditional “waterfall” approach was that work would take months or years to deliver rather than weeks or days, but that’s not all.

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles that stem from a long history of trying to bring iterative and incremental development methods to software development by setting standards and principles.

In 2001, seventeen software developers met at a resort in Snowbird, Utah to discuss these lightweight development methods, including among others Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber, Jim Highsmith, Alistair Cockburn, and Bob Martin. Together they published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.

Before the agile manifesto, there were a number of methodologies and frameworks such as Kanban,  Scrum, from 1995; Crystal Clear and extreme programming (XP), both from 1996. The principles behind these were fed into the agile manifesto.

Values and Principles
The agile software development approach is founded in a set of four core values, individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, responding to change over following a plan. This forms the basis which form what they believe to be a better way to software development.

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is outlines twelve principles:
Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
Working software is the primary measure of progress
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

The benefits are quite straightforward:
It means you can be more adaptive rather than predictive, in a very fast moving industry, this is important.
It means you can deliver iteratively, rather than a big bang release, helping to alleviate big problems and lots of stress.
Importance is put on face to face communication, with a view to optimise the return on investment (ROI) and ensure alignment with customer needs and company goals.
The feedback loop shortens as you close the feedback loop and listen to the customer is essential to adapt.
Quality improves as everyone is responsible for quality.
Good code, processes and tools, as well as easy to use software means less comprehensive documentation is needed.
Being agile means you can tailor your methods to suit your needs, by having a good foundation in principles, you can choose the right methods for what you need
You can scale due to a stronger alignment between teams

That doesn’t mean agile is without its pitfalls, they come with some warnings and anti-patterns.

Warnings
If you’re already skeptical of agile, perhaps because you’ve heard about when it does go wrong

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you don’t need any plan, architecture or designs at all, neither should it be a big up front plan, architecture or design. What you want is a plan, architecture and design that is rough and adaptive. Your aim is to to bring alignment of the vision.
Don’t compromise on your commitments to what you agreed. That means avoiding taking on new work requests that come up during the sprint, instead they should go onto the backlog.
You need support from stakeholders. If they don’t buy into agile or the benefits, then they may not understand what the approach you’re taking and why you’re taking it, which is likely to be met with challenge rather than support.
Your teammates will need support and guidance. It’s really important that you bring them along for the journey to avoid the “not built here” syndrome. Alignment is key to making this work.
Ensure that you have a product owner who is responsible for representing the business in the development activity 
Teams should be focused around product requirements, otherwise you risk compromising on commitments as priorities change across products
Avoid the need for a complete understanding and specification of all stories, just the confidence that you’ll be able to pick it and make progress, even if it means discovering more work is required
Daily standup shouldn’t be used for problem-solving, break out into smaller teams to do that.
Assign work yourself, not someone else. Teams are self-organising.
Test automation is key to a well functioning workflow and deployment strategy
Don’t let technical debt build up, you need to allow time for refactoring and bug fixes
Committing to more work than can be achieved in a sprint, don’t a attempt to take on too much in an iteration. Sprints should be commitment based on what the team believes they can complete
If time, resources, scope, and quality are fixed, then it’s not adaptive
Burnout is the loss of momentum, frequent planning, reviews and retrospectives help to break down the work as to avoid burnout
If you’re being asked to “burn down” or “burn up” stories, then this signals that stories are taking too much time. They are spending too much time in progress because they are incorrectly estimated or simply too big. Spend more time breaking down and/or unpacking the stories.
Having more than one level of “done” signals either a difference of opinion on what done is, or there’s a wall or gate between the first done and the second done. This leads to team members being siloed.
A standup meeting is called that because it should be short so you don’t get fed up of standing. If you are standing up too long, perhaps you have too many stories in flight, stories are too complex and should be broken down or perhaps the people are talking about other things rather than the stories.
Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that story points to measure progress. Don't waste too much time overthinking estimates, they are just estimates. Its a guide to help you keep moving forward. Remember, outcomes are what matter.
Agile doesn’t mean bending over backwards - if you find you’re asking to change the scope of a sprint and bring in other work, then you’re compromising what you committed to and the sprint goal
Scrum team-level velocity measure is not all that meaningful outside of the context of a particular team. Managers should never attempt to compare velocities of different teams or aggregate estimates across teams
Don’t get too bogged down in the detail. You can fall into the trap of becoming too scientific about story points and velocity, it’s unnessisary.

Generally how it works is quite straightforward, let’s talk about the workflow.
Workflow
You start with a product and break it down into epics and stories. A story or user story is a software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language.

Stories are often expressed in the "as a <user or stakeholder>, I want <some feature>, so that <some business value>" form, as it gets you thinking about the who, what and why of a story. This is a good place to start because it gets you away from stories that are nothing more than just a title. An alternative is “In order to <achieve some business value>, as a <stakeholder type>, I want <some new system feature>”, putting the business value to the stakeholder first.

Stories need to have acceptance criteria, they should tell you when the story is done. They need to be specific, narrow and falsifiable, so you know when to stop coding and written in the language of the business domain. Often this will be presented as checklists, however, this may not be explicit enough, so you could consider “Given, When, Then” type scenarios.

The given part describes the state of the world before you begin the behavior you're specifying in this scenario. You can think of it as the pre-conditions to the test. The when section is that behavior that you're specifying. Finally the then section describes the changes you expect due to the specified behavior.

In agile and scrum teams, we give stories points as a way to estimate the effort involved in a piece of work. Unfortunately humans aren’t very good at accurately estimating how long something will take. 

Story points do not equate to time exactly. They are based on effort, complexity and doubt. Arguably it’s all effort, and by removing complexity and doubt, you’re able to give a better estimate of the effort involved in a story. Pointing should give you a sense of relative size, for example, we know the difference between a house and a skyscraper, were less concerned about 12 floors vs 14 floors.

Estimating using story points is a great tool to have because it helps you figure out if the story is the right size and shape. Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating. It’s loosely based on the Fibonacci sequence, the reason for using the Fibonacci sequence is to reflect the inherent uncertainty in estimating larger items. If estimates are not the same, the team should discuss the estimates, especially those with outlying values.

Estimating stories using planning poker is a great way to get the team aligned. For example, if one team member spots a problem, they might vote high to capture that issue, however other team members might not have spotted it, so will vote low. By voting and opening up the floor to the outliers, you give them the opportunity to discuss their concerns and bring alignment to the team. Equally, if the team vote quite high, then you might consider that the stories are too big and you may want to see if they can be broken down. Smaller stories will be favoured as they will show progress sooner.

Story estimates are a great tool for bringing understanding and alignment to the team, but not so good for measuring or predicting progress. Story points don’t really lend themselves to being a measure of wall-time or how long something will take.

For example, you might think that a three point story might take a couple of days, but if you’ve got 100 of them in progress and only one developer, then it will likely take much longer. Although this example might be a bit extreme, it does point out that story points alone cannot predict the wall-time expectation, they must be combined with the conditions of the environment.

Once pointed, a team will select the stories they wish to commit into an iteration. The Scrum framework uses the term “Sprint” for its iterations. Each sprint has a clear and achievable goal which the team will commit to achieving. Stories can change scope during a sprint, providing they don’t impact the the sprint goal.

Though the agile manifesto says nothing about velocity or commitment, the Scrum framework is quite prescriptive about it. Scrum promotes “commitment-driven planning” rather than “velocity-driven planning”. Using a commitment-driven method means that the team is able to function as a cohesive team, be autonomous and continuously improve.

Scrum demands a full-team commitment: If you’re behind, I’ll help, and I know you’ll do the same for me. It’s not “these are my tasks” and “those are yours.” - Mike Cohn

Velocity is variable, it does go up and down, so it only really becomes useful in the long term as a rough guideline. It may eventually become useful for a long term team on a long running product, but this is rarely the case.

Stories go on a board, often described as a “kanban board”. Kanban means many things. Literally, Kanban is a Japanese word that means “visual card”. Kanban is also the name of a lean approach to agile software development, which differs to the Scrum framework that most people are familiar with.

The kanban approach is useful when following the Scrum framework is no longer helping you to improve, when you’re in a high-interrupt team with priorities that shift daily or you’re spending too much time in planning and estimating than is helpful.

The board can be physical, digital or both. There’s many good reasons to have a physical board, it means that you don’t have to rely on a computer, it gives a central gathering place for daily stand-ups, they are always visible and it gives you a sense of progress in the real world as well as in the digital - the physical action of moving a story across a board in the physical world gives you that physical sense of satisfaction and positive reinforcement.

Having standups around boards gives the whole team the opportunity to meet every day for a quick status update. It’s called a stand up to keep the meeting short. Everyone in the team should attend the daily standup. It should be the same time, same place, daily. Usually at the start or end of the day. Usually 15 minutes or less. Walk the board from right to left, top to bottom. The person assigned should talk for the story. Once finished, handover to the next assignee of the next story.

The stories can’t talk for themselves, so you have to. Talk about what’s happening next, mention any blockers or problems, do mention your wins as well. You don’t have to go into lots of detail, just enough for people to grasp where the story is at. What did you achieve yesterday? What are you going to achieve today? What risks are going to stop you? If it helps, make sure you update your stories before standup, or at the end of the day.

For bugs, we treat them in a similar way to stories, there’s no reason they shouldn’t follow the same workflow as a story, however we do need to be able to track their progress and report back to stakeholders.

Along with bugs, stories and tasks, we also have spikes. A spike is an experiment, spikes are time boxed and creates throwaway code, it should create learnings.
Process
For stories and bugs, you can use “issue tracking” software such as JIRA, Bugzilla, Trello, Trac, etc. Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team". Good issue tracking software will allow you to integrate with version control and pull requests.

Modern version control platforms such as GitHub or Bitbucket allow you to do “pull requests” with ease. Pull requests are a great opportunity for you to review your peers code. Code reviews are an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverable examine it for defects and improvement opportunities. It’s said that peer code reviews are the single biggest thing you can do to improve your code.

To avoid technical debt building up, it’s important to fix bugs and refactor code as you go. Non-functional requirements, such as monitoring, logging, unit test code coverage, code quality, and coding standards, deployments, acceptance testing, service testing, end to end testing, capacity and load testing should all be factored into the stories as they are defined. This ensures that quality is built-in. If you don’t do this, then you’ll need to add non-functional stories to the backlog and pay down that technical debt to avoid software entropy. You need to fix the broken windows in order to prevent things from getting worse.

“Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior”
― Martin Fowler

We have to encourage the right behaviours, we have to lay out our principles and nurture the right culture. Continuous delivery has five principles that fit nicely with agile, they are: build quality in; work in small batches; computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems; relentlessly pursue continuous improvement; everyone is responsible. A good example of putting continuous delivery and agile principles into action is by using deployment pipelines instead of an extensive documented process. 

Keeping everything in version control means you can easily keep track of changes, review code and maintain a source of truth. Trunk-based development is an essential step in getting to continuous deployment.
Measuring
We think about how to measure the success of our processes. How fast our builds run, how long our tests take, how many bugs we have, how many fatal errors there are in production, what our availability is, our time to recovery, how performant our application platform is, how much test coverage our code.

It’s important that we are aware of how to measure the success of a story or feature. It’s rewarding to know that the work you have done has a business impact. The agile principles say that “working software is the primary measure of progress”. It’s interesting because it puts a big emphasis on working software being a priority but progress being the goal.

To me, “working software” doesn’t just mean “working code”, there’s no point writing the most beautiful code if nobody uses it, it’s software that works for our users that we’re interested in. It means building the right thing, the right way.

You need to also think about “progress” as being a measurement that acts as a key performance indicator. This is where an iterative approach becomes very powerful.

To show progress you need to release early and release often and listen to the customer. This allows you to demonstrate working software to the customer and act on their feedback in a very short space of time. Being able to react to a customer’s feedback very quickly is a unique selling point that you should want to have over your competitors.

The agile principles put a big emphasis on working software being a priority but progress being the goal. I therefore think it’s really worth thinking about “progress” being a measurement and how you can best demonstrate that.

In a traditional “waterfall” approach, it would be quite difficult to demonstrate or even measure progress, however in this scenario, you would be able to get feedback from the customer as soon as the software is working.

In order to truly honour the principle set out in the agile manifesto, to show progress you need to release early and release often so that you can demonstrate working software to the customer to get their feedback.

In order to demonstrate working software, it must be of a quality where it does not fail. We must have some measures in place to ensure it is working. We need to know that our code is of a good quality, there are no bugs that prevent it from working, the pipeline does not fail to build. Fixing issues then becomes a top priority.

We also need to measure progress, so how long does a unit of work take to go from conception to inception where the user can use it - this is known as “lead time”. But what about how long it takes a developer? That’s cycle time. Build time is another good one. Anything we can measure to demonstrate that we’re able to progress quicker through the work is a good metric.
People
All developers should be responsible for responding to outages and being on call, as well as designing and evolving the monitoring and alerting systems, and the metrics behind them. This means that the developers control the entire lifecycle, including operational tasks like backup, monitoring and, of course, on call rotation. 

Shu-Ha-Ri is a term founded in Japanese martial arts which talks about learning the way of the master, branching out and trying new things, then finally creating your own techniques. In order for us to master our art, we must first learn the rules. In order to learn the rules, we must set the rules first. It’s important then, that we align ourselves with a set of principles that we can agree on.

We need to be transparent. Get everyone together at the beginning and keep meeting. We need to make it easy for everyone to see what’s happening. We need to be realistic and manage expectations. We really need to trust our teams of motivated individuals to commit to building the product. I can understand that trust might be an issue for some teams, so employ a trust but verify approach to begin with. Remember, outcomes are what matters - not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, how much work is completed.

We should accept that systems fail us, not the people. Failures are learning opportunities, and messengers of them should not be punished. Use blameless post mortems to get to the root cause of the problem and seek to resolve the issue. Remember, processes are there to protect people.

People should be rewarded for collaboration, experimentation, and system-level improvements. Encourage collaboration, share responsibility. Leave things better than you found them. Always be learning, welcome new ideas.
Behaviours
Continuous improvement, or Kaizen in Japanese, is a method for identifying opportunities for streamlining work and reducing waste. It's a key idea from the Lean movement. Taiichi Ohno, a key figure in the history of the Toyota company, once said,

Kaizen opportunities are infinite. Don’t think you have made things better than before and be at ease… This would be like the student who becomes proud because they bested their master two times out of three in fencing. Once you pick up the sprouts of kaizen ideas, it is important to have the attitude in our daily work that just underneath one kaizen idea is yet another one.

Don’t treat transformation as a project to be embarked on and then completed so we can return to business as usual. The best organisations are those where everybody treats improvement work as an essential part of their daily work, and where nobody is satisfied with the status quo.

Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement. Strive for continuous improvement in everything we do. Change is opportunity. Never be afraid to make things better. Seek success through bold action and risk-taking, not security through the status quo. Eliminate every form of waste. Encourage innovative ideas.

“Cease dependence on mass inspection to achieve quality. Improve the process and build quality into the product in the ﬁrst place” - W. Edwards Deming

Release testing is high cost, low value risk management. We should encourage the right behaviours, if we want to make a change that will improve the process, removing human error or improving build time, we should do it. We shouldn't be scared to make things better. We shouldn't add in manual steps to prevent mistakes as that is just risk management theatre.

“Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers”

Release early points to the fact that that until code is in production, no value is actually being generated. It means getting a minimum viable product out to users without compromising on quality. It means that perhaps the customer will be happy with a bike until a car is available.

Release often means that you need practice. If it’s difficult, do it more. Do it until it’s easy. Do it until it’s just one click. Doing a little and often is how you become an expert. How do you eat an elephant? One piece at a time.

Listening to customers means closing the loop, focusing on building a quality product that people want to use. If quality is a top priority then compromise is not an option. We have to put our efforts into understanding the behaviours that are expected by the end user, rather than making assumptions that could be wrong, or worse, take longer to test and resolve later.

“The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.” -- Mark Twain

Automate repetitive tasks. Replace yourself with automation - If you find you’re repeating the same commands or tasks, automate them. The less manual steps there are the less opportunity there is for error. We should let the computer perform the repetitive tasks, leaving us humans to solve problems. Gets humans out of the deployment business.

“If it hurts, do it more frequently, and bring the pain forward.” ― Jez Humble, Author of "Continuous Delivery

Everyone is responsible for quality. Having a QA role or team can cause silos, QA gates and bottlenecks which slow the process down. Instead, we should focus on Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) principles such as “Quality built-in” and “Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems” and nurture that as part of the culture.
Organisation
You need to control the flow, you need to limit the work in progress. Everyone needs idle time or slack time. If there's no slack time, work will get stuck in the process. Once you’re committed to getting to a goal, the aim should be to complete all work in progress (WIP) before picking up any new work. Limit the amount of work in progress, this encourages a “divide and conquer” pair programming approach, encourages people to be T-shaped, instead of people working in silos.

“Accounting for Conway’s Law should be front of mind, when it comes to structuring teams” - Fausto de la Torre, Head of Technology, Ecuador

Conway’s law tells us that organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. If your organisation is monolithic, your architecture will be too.

In the microservice paradigm, you can structure your teams in a way that will facilitate a microservice system architecture, changing an organisation’s team structure to fit the IT systems.

At Amazon, in early 2000s, people were saying that groups needed to communicate more. Bezos said, 'No, communication is terrible!'. The pronouncement shocked his managers. But Bezos pursued his idea of a decentralised, disentangled company where small groups can innovate and test their visions independently of everyone else.

Bezos came up with the notion of the 'two-pizza team': If you can't feed a team with two pizzas, it's too large. That limits a team to five to seven people, depending on their appetites.

By being strict about the way data is shared between departments or teams, you can easily understand the shape that this could take. Teams and communication structures modelled after the architecture we want.

"It's much more scalable having microservices in this way, because you're not storing everything in a classic relational database” - Basho CTO Dave McCrory

Data should be exposed through service interfaces and each microservice should talk to others through these interfaces. There should be no concept of sharing data in any other way, no shared files, no email attachments, no file uploads, no direct connections to databases. Only communication via the service interface over the network. These service interfaces, agnostic of technology, will need to be designed as if it were to be a public interface, built as if it were to be available to the outside world.
Culture
The way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do.Those of us trying to change our organization's’ culture need to define the things we want to do, the ways we want to behave and want each other to behave, to provide training and then to do what is necessary to reinforce those behaviors. The culture will change as a result.

For me, agile is that. It’s about values and attitudes, ideas and behaviours. It's a way of thinking, a way of doing and a way of being. Practicing as well as preaching. It's about taking the best experiences and sharing those with others. It's a conversation.

Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day - Jim Rohn

For those that haven’t tried agile, are sceptical or don’t think it works, I’d say, to learn it, try it, teach it, then make it your own.
