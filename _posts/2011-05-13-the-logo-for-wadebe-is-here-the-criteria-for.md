The logo for wade.be is here!
The criteria for the logo was to be instantly recognisable, easily adaptable and subtlety intriguing.
I’ve become increasingly fond of the “Journal” typeface so I’ve decided to use it in the design.
I added the asterisks to draw the viewer to it in the same way as you would take note of a footnote at the bottom of an article.
The logo will generally appear white in colour on a dark grey background, but equally can appear grey on a white background.
