  I have been looking for a decent FTP client for years, and now I think I have finally found it!
</p>

<!--more-->Here are some other FTP clients I have tried over the years.

  * [LeechFTP](http://web.archive.org/web/20060701085348/http://stud.fh-heilbronn.de:80/%7Ejdebis/leechftp/) was good, I used it for years, but they have stopped developing it, and bitbeamer that was suposed to replace it never happened.
  * [BulletProof FTP](http://www.bpftp.com/) is good, I have used it for years, but I get the feeling its not worth $29.95, especially when its something that should be free.
  * FlashFXP is a pain as they are ALWAYS updating it and there's about a million different versions, it costs $25.
  * [SmartFTP](http://www.smartftp.com/) is free, but it just doesn't cut it in the real world, its useless at times and difficult to use.
  * [CuteFTP](http://www.cuteftp.com/) I never liked, its over priced (at $59.99) and over rated.

The answer is here at last&#8230;

[FileZilla](http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/) has the answer, its free, its open source, its up-to-date and it works. (Although it would be good if you could import settings from other clients)

Well its either that or using the ftp command provided with windows.

Note: Since I wrote this I have been told to check out SmartFTP v2, as I am told it is far better than v1, and its free!
