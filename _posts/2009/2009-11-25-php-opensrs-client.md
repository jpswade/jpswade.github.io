<p class="lead">
  This is only a quick message to say that I am now developing the <em>PHP OpenSRS Client project</em>.
</p>

OpenSRS-PHP is a PHP-based client class that communicates with the TuCows OpenSRS Domain Name Registry System via an API.

I have just released version 2.8.1 with many long awaited fixes.

Enjoy!
