<p class="lead">
  OpenCart is an open source PHP-based e-commerce online shop website solution. Ideal for new or existing stores to start selling online.
</p>

OpenCart all began because (at the time) the leading open source e-commerce solution out there was not very good, to say the least.

<!--more-->The first public release was OpenCart v0.2 back in early 2006 and has been gaining momentum ever since.

The project is lead by Daniel Kerr, and I have also recently joined the team.

I have been working on 0.7.9 since I released 0.7.8 back in July. OpenCart is now a much more stable platform, and we are now looking to start adding new features in 0.8.

Enjoy!
