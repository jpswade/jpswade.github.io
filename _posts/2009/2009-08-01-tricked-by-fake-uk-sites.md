  Trading standards say that consumers are being <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8178959.stm">tricked into buying fake goods</a> online by companies based in China pretending to be based in the UK by using &#8220;.co.uk&#8221; domain names. There are ways to avoid getting caught out&#8230;<!--more-->
</p>

A quick an easy way to not get caught out is to do a [domain name whois lookup](http://whoisx.co.uk/), this will very quickly tell you the details of who registered the domain name, which will give you a good indication as to whether it is fake or not.

If you're still not sure, just ask and I'll be willing to help you out.
