  I wanted to find some software to help organise my DVD collection.
</p>

At first I thought there was only a few, but I soon discovered that there are quite a few&#8230;

Firstly I intend to find one I like and use it to organise my DVD collection. My favourite so far is DVD Profiler, however once you get to 50 DVDs, you must pay to add more. I easily have over 100.

I didn't really like many of the free or open source ones and some didn't seem to even work correctly, however, I have no intention of paying for something that really should be free.

As you can probably see, there are a few entries in Wikipedia, so eventually I may palatially port this list to Wikipedia.

Let me know if you find this useful and let me know how you get on with the software.

Thanks.
