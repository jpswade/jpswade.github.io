  After discussing website improvements with the <a href="http://www.randles.co.uk/">Randles Motor Group</a> marketing manager we decided that the website needed a new navigation menu with simple requirements:
</p>

  * Accommodate additional pages
  * Improve search engine visibility
  * Improve user experience
  * Less white-space

Originally the navigation was a flat horizontal menu at the very top of the page, which had a “hint” saying “Browse our website” with an arrow to make it obvious to novice users that this is how you navigate the website.

To tackle the criteria I did the following:

  * Adding sub-menus to accommodate the new pages and improve visibility.
  * A menu bar was created across the width of the page which separates the header from the footer filling any undesirable white-space.
  * The more familiar look and feel of the menu bar with the drop down menus gives the end user a better experience as it is more familiar to them.

I’m sure you’ll agree that the new menu is an improvement on the old, and if not, let me know!
