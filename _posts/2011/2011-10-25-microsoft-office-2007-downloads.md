One of my customers has specialist database software built on the FileMaker Pro database engine. The unfortunate downside to this is that certain legacy plugins they are using for FileMaker only support Microsoft Office 2003 or 2007 and not the latest Office 2010. This means that any new systems need to purchase legacy versions of Microsoft Office, which seems to be almost impossible apart from purchasing old stock. I managed to find that a reputable retailer (eBuyer) had some suitable licenses in stock:

  * Microsoft Office Small Business 2007 &#8211; W/ MS Office Professional 2007 (Trial) &#8211; licence &#8211; 1 PC &#8211; OEM, MLK &#8211; Win

As you can see, this is for Microsoft Office Small Business 2007, this include Outlook (unlike the Home and Student version) and Publisher (Unlike the Standard version or below). This license is suitable for their needs. One major downside to this is that &#8220;MLK&#8221; means &#8220;Medialess License Kit&#8221;, which means they do not supply a CD or DVD with this purchase, just the license key. Perfect, well almost: Where the heck do you get the media from? <!--more--> I don't have a copy of Microsoft Office Small Business 2007. Nobody I know has a copy of Microsoft Office Small Business 2007. Even the largest bit torrent website on the planet doesn't have Microsoft Office Small Business 2007. You can't purchase a CD or DVD if you tried, they simply aren't on sale. With a little searching I managed to find official Microsoft Office 2007 Direct Download Links:
