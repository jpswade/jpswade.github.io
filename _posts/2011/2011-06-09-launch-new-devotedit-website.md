<p class="lead">
  I’ve quietly been working on <a href="http://www.devotedit.com/">devotedit.com</a> in the background and now it’s ready!
</p>

The new website is powered by WordPress and the theme is a custom built theme based on the original design.

The benefit of the new website is that it combines the [DevotedIT blog](http://www.devotedit.com/blog/) and [information about the business](http://www.devotedit.com/about) into one, easy to navigate website.

This replaces the old site which was a single page, single purpose site which served it’s purpose, but was not able to scale with the expansion of the business.

The new pages and the blog are designed to give confidence to new clients finding out about the business for the first time.
