<p class="lead">
  These days I find myself buying all sorts of things off of ebay.
</p>

The problem I have found in the past is that I cannot keep track of the items I am bidding on, and then forget about them, consequently ending up with nothing.
  
I set out to find a FREE method of tracking eBay auctions. An application that allows you to snipe would be good too.

My first port of call was freshmeat.net, where I found:

  * [BidNobble](http://bidnobble.com/) &#8211; This piece of software looked great, however I soon find out that it doesn&#8217;t actually work correctly.
  * [eBay Agent](http://freshmeat.net/projects/ebayagent/) &#8211; This was a nice application written in Perl, which could be run from a server however with no decent frontend.
  * [bidwatcher](http://bidwatcher.sourceforge.net/) &#8211; This application was okay, the problem was it was slow, and this didn&#8217;t work properly either.
  * Bid Monkey &#8211; Written in python, I tried this, I didn&#8217;t like it at all.
  * [JBidwatcher](http://www.jbidwatcher.com/) &#8211; Another java based Bit watcher, that is very poorly designed, and difficult to work with.

I crawled the internet for other applications out there, only to find they don&#8217;t REALLY exist.

In the end the best thing I found was a Google Gadget for Google Desktop called [eBay Auction Watch](http://web.archive.org/web/20110904104146/http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/auctionwatch.html?hl=en). This plug-in is fantastic, its just a shame you&#8217;re forced to use it with Google Desktop considering it uses so much system resources.
