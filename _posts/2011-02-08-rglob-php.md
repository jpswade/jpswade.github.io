<p class="lead">
  Today I was having a look on PHP.net and noticed a PHP contest so I decided to submit one of my functions.
</p>

I chose the [rglob() function](http://code.google.com/p/hm2k/source/browse/trunk/code/php/functions/rglob.php).

<!--more-->

I first wrote the simple [recursive](http://www.google.co.uk/search?&q=recursion) glob() function [rglob for php.net back in 2008](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.glob.php#87221).

I chose it because (according to Google Analytics) it&#8217;s the second most popular PHP function in my open source code collection, which means people are actually using it and it&#8217;s more simpler yet comprehensive than the most popular (file\_post\_contents).

The proof is there that you are actually using it, so now perhaps you can do something for me&#8230;

Thanks!
