<p class="lead">
  For some time I have been meaning to update my website, I had decided long ago that if I did create a new site it would use the wordpress engine, as I didn't like the updates of the engine I used previously, which was cutenews.

On the 12th of August 2006 I purchased back HM2K.com after not having it since 2002, I decided to use this for my new site.

Before I created a new site I wanted to decide on a purpose, giving the site more focus resulting in a more successful website. After some time I realised what it was that I wanted to do with my website.

I wanted to make it a central point where I could document my (almost daily) research. As part of my work I find myself doing a lot of research, gathering information on many issues, perhaps information that does exist, but with limited coverage or such. The purpose of the site would be to report my findings on my website, not only for my personal use but to assist others.

In addition to this I would place details of my projects and articles I have written in the past.
  
And so the new site was born.

Enjoy!
