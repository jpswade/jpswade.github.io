  I love free stuff, it's probably why I like open source so much&#8230;
</p>

I think we must all like free stuff, so I have decided to gather a few sites together that offer up-to-date free stuff.

There's all sorts of junk you can get for free, mostly by filling in a form online with your details.

There are usually limited ties too, most of the time its purely a case of a product awareness campaign.

Here are a few sites you can try:

  * [TheFreeSite.com](http://www.thefreesite.com/) &#8211; This site has been around for years, probably the most renowned. However it does seem to have grown quite uncontrollably large, offers free online services as well as products, lacks frequent updates, and is targeted at the US population. (US based)
  * [Freebie Forum](http://www.freebieforum.co.uk/) &#8211; This forum has over 1500 active members. You can usually find free stuff fairly quickly. (UK)
  * [Bob's Free Stuff Forum](http://www.bobsfreestuffforum.co.uk/) &#8211; A very cool populated forum, offering live up-to-date stuff for free. There's over 10,000 members on this forum. (UK)
  * [Money Saving Expert.com Freebies](http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.html?f=37) &#8211; This is a heavily populated forum by people always looking to save money, you can expect to find good stuff as soon as it's known here. (UK)
  * [FreeUKStuff.com](http://www.freeukstuff.com/) &#8211; Kinda cool, offers you quite a good selection, you can make comments too, but you must be a member, membership is free. (UK)
  * freebiesblog.net &#8211; Freebie blog site. (US based)
  * [FreeStuffChannel](http://www.freestuffchannel.com/) &#8211; Freebie site with RSS feed. (US based)
  * [FreeGrabber](http://www.freegrabber.com/) &#8211; Another freebie site blog with RSS feed. (US based)
  * [Free Stuff Exchange Forum](http://www.exchange.free-stuff.me.uk/) &#8211; This is only a small forum, but can sometimes offer some good stuff. (UK)
  * [Free-Stuff](http://www.free-stuff.co.uk/) &#8211; A site updated 3 times per week apparently. (UK)
  * Freebiersclub &#8211; Members only, but its pretty awsum! (UK)
  * [Free Stuff Junction Site List](http://www.freestuffjunction.co.uk/top/) &#8211; A list of freebie sites. (UK)
  * Find more [free stuff on DMOZ](http://www.dmoz.com/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Free_Stuff/Link_Pages/)

Enjoy your free junk!
