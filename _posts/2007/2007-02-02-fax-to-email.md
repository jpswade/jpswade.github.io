  Fax to email is perhaps one of the most interesting, oldest and most overlooked technology.
</p>

These days although it seems like everyone has an email address, there are businesses that rely on their fax machine asif its their only means of communication to the outside world.

However, we can't always be around to man a fax machine 24/7/365, so usually you're left with a number of options:

  * Wait until you return so you can check your fax machine
  * Get someone else to check your fax machine, then send them to your current location
  * Tell people sending the fax to send to a different number depending on your location at the time
  * Tell them to scan it in and email it to you
  * Tell them not to bother at all

As you are probably aware for businesses that are none stop 24/7, if you are unable to reach critical information it is possible to loose business.

There is really only one solution&#8230;

That is you must have a computer, broadband, a fax modem, a phone line, and a piece of software to tie it all together.

The software you require must do the following functions:

  * Receive faxes
  * Send faxes via email.
  * Distinguish the difference between voice calls and faxes
  * Act as an answering machine if a voice call is received
  * Have some method of remotely accessing or sending voice messages

So far the only software I have found that will do this task is called [FaxTalk](http://www.faxtalk.com/), in particular FaxTalk Messenger Pro 7. This software is GREAT! It has the following features:

  * Complete voice messaging and fax solution.
  * Access contacts from Microsoft Outlook 2000/2002/2003 and Windows Address Book.
  * Send faxes over the internet to any email address.
  * Forward received faxes and messages by email.
  * Access received faxes and voice messages in Microsoft Outlook.
  * Receive calls and send faxes when logged out of Windows 2000/XP.
  * Block the reception of unwanted junk faxes.
  * Process received voice messages and faxes using notification rules.

And so much more, the list is endless! This is the ultimate solution.

However I didn't stop there&#8230;

I also looked other fax to email solutions including fax gateways.

Tiscali offer a [fax gateway](http://web.archive.org/web/20090221220805/http://fax.tiscali.co.uk:80/) to all of their members, and since its free to [signup to Tiscali](http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/jump/websitemembership.html), its available to anyone. Once your signed up and logged in, you simply assign yourself a new number and you can receive faxes via email/webmail via your new number as of immediate effect.

There are many other broadband providers (such as [Demon](http://web.archive.org/web/20100216153952/http://www.demon.net:80/toolkit/electronicfax/)) that offer a similar service free providing you have a business broadband package with them, unlike BT, who simply are unaware of such a service.

Another fax gateway to have a look at is [yac.com](http://www.yac.com/), apparently its free!
