<p class="lead">
  The <a href="http://eggtcl.github.io/"><strong>eggtcl project</strong></a> is a repository of approved TCL scripts for <a href="http://www.eggdrop.org/">eggdrop</a> that allow you to easily update them as new versions are released.
</p>

> The plan is to maintain a library collection of good quality eggdrop tcl scripts to ensure the longevity of this project and the eggdrop project.

<!--more-->A dedicated team of highly skilled people will develop and approve only the best scripts for eggdrop.

**The team:**

  * FireEgl &#8211; notable for his [Tcldrop](http://www.tcldrop.us/)
  * hrz &#8211; long serving #eggtcl EFnet channel op and script writer
  * Pixelz &#8211; eggdrop and Tcldrop contributor and script writer
  * simple &#8211; [eggheads](http://www.eggheads.org/)
  * thommey &#8211; [eggheads](http://www.eggheads.org/) and [tclhelp.net](http://www.tclhelp.net/)

The project hopes to make poorly written eggdrop scripts a thing of the past and to become the official eggdrop tcl repository.
