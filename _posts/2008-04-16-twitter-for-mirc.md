<p class="lead">
  I signed up for Twitter quite some months ago, but have yet really found myself using it.
</p>

I&#8217;m sure some of you are wondering what twitter actually is. The best way to describe it is a way to tell people you know what you&#8217;re up to. It fills the gap between emails and blogs.

This way, your friends can find out what you&#8217;re up to without having to actually ask you, and only if they&#8217;re interested.

Quite a novel idea.<!--more-->

However, I found myself NOT using it. My reasoning behind this was mainly because loading the site in a browser, logging in, and submitting a message was a rather long winded process.

However, thankfully, as it turns out, they have an API which I can send my message to along with my login details to update my status.

And so it was born! [Twitter for mIRC](http://hm2k.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/code/mirc/twitter.mrc).

At the moment the script is just an updater, maybe in the future I will write some RSS feed reader for mIRC so you can see what your friends are doing on twitter via mIRC, but only if the demand is there&#8230;
