  I have a Blackberry Pearl 8900 on O2, I&#8217;ve had it a while now.
</p>

One big gripe I had with it is that the ringer doesn&#8217;t last long enough.

By the time I&#8217;ve pulled it out of my pocket, taken it out of it&#8217;s pocket, and assessed whether I want to answer the call, it&#8217;s already too late, especially if I&#8217;m in the middle of doing something else.

So, I can&#8217;t expect it to be perfect, but surely the ring time can be extended or increased? Here&#8217;s the solution&#8230;

<!--more-->Enter *\*61\*901\*11\*xx# in to the phone, where xx is, enter the amount of time you want it to ring before it goes to voicemail.

For example: *\*61\*901\*11\*30# would mean it would ring for 30 seconds before going on to voicemail.

I&#8217;ve no idea what the default was, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s too low.

_Next:_ Use a ringtone that doesn&#8217;t have a silent lead.

Hope this helps!

Enjoy!
