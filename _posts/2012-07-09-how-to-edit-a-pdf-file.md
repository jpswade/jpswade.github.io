PDF files are by nature not really designed to be edited by the end user, instead you&#8217;re expected to go back to the original source and change that before &#8220;publishing&#8221; it as a PDF file. Much like you would with a printed page.

Sometimes however this isn&#8217;t always possible to go back to the source. Often because you lost the original source, you weren&#8217;t the original author or it&#8217;s based on data that you entered into a long-winded form and you don&#8217;t want to have to re-enter it all over again.<!--more-->

Such is the latter in this case.

The request was to modify a couple of dates in a document that were written as US date format, rather than UK date format.

I looked at the file and realised it was a PDF file.

My initial response was to go back to the original author, but as I was soon told that creating the whole document from scratch would take a long time and unfortunately there was no way to go back and edit it.

Like most people I had Adobe Reader (it&#8217;s free and reads PDF files), but I didn&#8217;t have any PDF creation or editing software installed.

It may seem like Adobe Acrobat is the obvious choice for editing PDF files, but you&#8217;d be wrong. This software is primarily used for authoring PDF files, but not editing them and it&#8217;s expensive (£139 via Google Shopping at time of writing).

I began investigating further checking out the &#8220;[List of PDF software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PDF_software)&#8221; on Wikipedia.

The next choice was Adobe Photoshop. Again this is expensive and when I tried it, it imported it in as a rendered image. It didn&#8217;t allow me to edit the text.

Some of the editors considered open source, &#8220;multi-platform&#8221; such as Libreoffice, OpenOffice Draw, Inkscape I already had installed anyway, but again like Photoshop I found that it wasn&#8217;t really suitable.

There are a few command-line tools out there, but they offer very little editing ability to the actual content, only the ability to make changes to the document itself such as: add/remove pages, rotate pages, split, rotate, watermark. Nothing to change actual text.

I don&#8217;t think I even tried NitroPDF, I wasn&#8217;t convinced it was what I needed and I seem to recall it left me wanting to uninstall it immediately. I know for sure thought if you want the 14-day trial, you&#8217;re forced to hand over your email address. No thanks.

I tried two online offerings, [DocQ PDFVUE](https://docq.com/landing/pdfvue/), this would allow me to add new text layers, but not edit the existing text. There was a similar story with [PDFescape](http://www.pdfescape.com).

Then I discovered [Infix PDF Editor](http://www.iceni.com/), priced at just £20, free to try, easy to download, despite the slightly cheesy website, I loved the software from the outset. I knew it was the right option when I read this description on the website:

> It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you change a single word, a paragraph, or an entire page. Infix is the only PDF editor that covers your back, reflowing and reformatting text to keep it looking good. Once you’ve saved a file, you can’t even tell it’s been edited.

Perfect. Low and behold it does exactly what it says on the tin!

Simply load it up, choose the &#8220;Standard&#8221; option, then you&#8217;re free to click around on any bit of text and correct it accordingly.

My qualm came when I came to save. I could only save with a watermark otherwise I&#8217;d have to buy. No problem, I thought, 20 quid isn&#8217;t much. As it turns out the &#8220;Standard&#8221; edition is £59 (when you only buy one copy).

However, I don&#8217;t think they could have made the software itself any simpler if they tried and the fact that there&#8217;s nothing else out there like this on the market means you&#8217;re only left pondering the price.
