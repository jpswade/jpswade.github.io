There&#8217;s lots of ways to prevent a malware (virus or spyware) infection for free, here&#8217;s a list:<!--more-->

  1. Remove malware (You can&#8217;t prevent something that&#8217;s already in your system) 
      * Install and run [Malwarebytes&#8217; Anti-Malware](http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php)
      * Try an online anti-virus such as [TrendMicro HouseCall](http://housecall.trendmicro.com/) or [Panda ActiveScan](http://www.pandasecurity.com/activescan/index/)
      * Still got problems? Tools such as [HiJackThis](http://free.antivirus.com/hijackthis/) andÂ [ComboFix](http://www.getcombofix.com/) are helpful
  2. Install free anti-virus software 
      * If you are on a business network, contact your _IT administrator_
      * Make your own choose from a [list of antivirus software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_antivirus_software)_
  
_ 
      * You only need one and so uninstall any others (such as Norton or McAfee)
      * You can [download and register Avast! Home](http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html) which is free for personal use
  3. Stop using Internet Explorer 
      * Download and Install [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/) (free)
  4. Updates 
      * Check [Windows Updates](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/)
      * Check your [Browser is up to date](http://ismybrowseruptodate.com/)
      * Check your anti-virus software has the latest definitions
      * Check Adobe Acrobat Reader (or get [FoxIt Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/reader/) instead)
      * Check [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml)
      * Check [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/)
      * Ask the vendor about updates for any other software that you use regularly that connects to the internet
  5. Firewall 
      * You should not need any more than _Windows Firewall_ that comes with Windows XP or above, ensure it is [enabled](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283673)
      * If you use a modem (usually connected via USB), it is recommend asking your _Internet Service Provider_ (ISP) to upgrade you to a router (for network or WiFi connection). If you&#8217;re not sure, call your ISP and ask
      * If you are using _Windows 2000_ or below, get [Kerio Personal Firewall](http://web.archive.org/web/20030605135530/http://www.kerio.com/dwn/kpf2-en-win.exe)
      * You can test your firewall using [grc.com leaktest](http://grc.com/lt/leaktest.htm) or [hackerwatch.org probe](http://www.hackerwatch.org/probe/)
  6. Block bad sites 
      * Use [OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/) (ask your network administrator)
      * Using your own [hosts file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29) ([mvps.org hosts](http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm) or [hphosts](http://www.hosts-file.net/?s=Download))
  7. Filter your email 
      * Make sure your mail provider uses spam filtering software such as [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/) &#8212; you may have to ask
      * Consider using [Google Mail (Gmail)](http://mail.google.com/) instead since their spam filter is second to none
      * Ensure your mail is scanned by a virus checker, either by your host or by your computer

Hope this helps!
