<p class="lead">
  I’ve been running the Suzuki4u website since 2004. It’s now the biggest UK Suzuki forum.
</p>

However, because it was running outdated forum software it was getting over run by spam bots.

I reacted and updated the software to the latest version.

I also went ahead and updated the logo, but before I show you the new logo, let’s take a quick look at the logos over the years…

Suzuki4u 2011 Logo, ready for 2012 and beyond!

Anyway, checkout the updated Suzuki4u website and forum:

I’ll be introducing a new website in 2012, so watch this space!
