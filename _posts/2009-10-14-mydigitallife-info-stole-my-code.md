  I wrote a little script for an article entitled &#8220;Remove OGA Notifier&#8221;.
</p>

Today I discovered that [_mydigitallife.info_](http://whoisx.co.uk/mydigitallife.info) had clearly taken details from my batch file code and used it without giving any credit at all.

Just compare the actual functions in my removeoga.bat to their RemoveOGA.bat, you can clearly see it&#8217;s the same, yet no credit is given at all.

> mydigitallife.info is LAME.

Taking someone else&#8217;s code and not giving any credit for it is LAME, yes _mydigitallife.info_ is **lame** and I will be boycotting your site until further notice.

> ECHO 0.0.0.0 mydigitallife.info >> %systemdrive%\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

Simply copy this into a notepad window, and save as &#8220;mydigitallife_boycott.bat&#8221;, then run it.

Anyway, I&#8217;ve since improved my batch file to support more versions and languages, so if you copy that too, I&#8217;ll be on to you!

Thanks.
