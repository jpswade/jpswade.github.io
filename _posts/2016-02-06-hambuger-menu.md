A question raised at a recent [Staffs Web Meetup](http://staffswebmeetup.co.uk/) was:

    "Is the hamburger menu a lazy solution?"

On the face of it, the answer to this loaded question is yes, of course, but 
 that's not the end of it.

Although the answer is yes, who says lazy is a bad thing?

<!--more-->

It was eye opening as to how little people actually knew about this important 
 piece of UI, how far it had come and how quickly people were to dismiss it.

When it comes to interface design, people seem to be quite quick to quiz whether
 it's lazy to just copy design trends rather than think up their own.

In the case of the hamburger menu, the answer seems obvious to me.

The reason why so many people use it is that Facebook spent thousands of pounds
 teaching us what it is and it is baked into
 [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework))
 making it easy for web developers to consume.
 
 Google has baked it into the Chrome menu, and Xerox invented it in 1981, 
    originally intended to represent the [look of a menu list](http://moovweb.com/blog/hamburger-menu-handy-tool-or-useless-icon/).

You might think then, that it's a bad thing to just lazily use a tried and
 tested design pattern. It's not, it's often exactly the right thing to do.

So what's lazier than lazily using the hamburger menu?

Lazier is what we used to do before the hamburger icon. Just a menu button that
 says "menu", but in [A/B testing you may find that it actually performs better!](http://exisweb.net/mobile-menu-abtest)

The key with the user experience is to make it obvious. When your users can't
 figure out how to navigate your application, that's when being lazy is a
 problem.

    "Remember, the three key things about an intuitive navigation system is that
     they tell you where you are, and they show you where else you can go. 
     Hamburger menus are terrible at both of those things, because the menu is 
     not on the screen. It's not visible."

    - [Mike Stern, Apple User Experience
     Evangelist](http://blog.manbolo.com/2014/06/30/apple-on-hamburger-menus)

So yes, the hamburger menu a lazy solution, as is a "menu" button.

Don't fall into the trap of premature optimisation.

It's a good idea to "lazily" implement a tried and tested solution, then A/B 
 test against another solution once you're confident it'll bring value to your
 application.

Or maybe just don't have hidden content at all...

For most of us, the simplest and laziest approach is going to be absolutely fine, but then
    if you're working on a cutting edge project, you probably want to spend a bit more time
    working out a more creative way for users to get to what they want.

Hint: It's less about the icon itself and more about the application on a whole.

### Update

Since originally writing this, you'll find that you only need to take a look at the [latest Pinterest iOS app](http://moovweb.com/blog/hamburger-menu-handy-tool-or-useless-icon/) to fully appreciate what I mean.

This new application appears to be completely devoid of the hamburger menu and instead has easy to navigate on screen icons.

As for the rest of us, I don't think we're truly ready to bin the hamburger menu just yet, but we can certainly begin to consider it.
