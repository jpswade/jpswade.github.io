If you&#8217;ve ever received a **virus warning** from your friends, family or co-workers, you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about. These virus warnings are hoaxes and are untrue reports.

For example, the [Olympic Torch virus is a hoax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Torch_%28virus_hoax%29) and was [identified back in early 2006](http://www.sophos.com/pressoffice/news/articles/2006/02/olympictorch.html), according to UK based anti-virus company Sophos.

You are encouraged NOT to forward these types of warnings to people as not only is it a **waste of time and bandwidth**, but it can also **confuse or worry** the recipient.

<!--more-->The best action to take is as follows:

  1. DO NOT forward the email to ANYONE.
  2. DELETE the email.

If you are part of a company, you should also adopt the following policy for people who send you these type of virus warning emails:

> You shall not forward any virus warnings of any kind to \*anyone\* other than your network administrator. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the virus warnings have come from an anti-virus vendor or been confirmed by any large computer company or your best friend. \*All\* virus warnings should be sent to the network administrator alone. It is network administrator&#8217;s job to send round all virus warnings, and a virus warning which comes from any other source should be ignored.

If you receive a virus warning from anyone other than your network administrator, you should inform them of this policy.

If you&#8217;re still concerned about viruses, you should ensure that your anti-virus software is installed and up to date. You don&#8217;t need to buy expensive software, there are many ways to [prevent a virus or malware infection for free](http://www.devotedit.com/2009/09/17/ways-to-prevent-malware-infection-for-free/), which are just as good.

So remember folks: don&#8217;t forward virus warnings, delete them.
