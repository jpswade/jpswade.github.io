<p class="lead">
  First of all I'd like to say thanks to everyone who has visited my website since I began at the start of last month.
</p>

So far I have been going pretty much full steam ahead with this, releasing all my articles and posts I could think of, at a rate of 1 per day.

Over the next few months my other projects are pretty much going to take a front seat, which will mean I will have less time for this website.

I am going to attempt to make a post every few days or so. You can keep track of my posts by adding the RSS feed to Firefox or your RSS reader.

If you use any of my projects, scripts, or found any of my information useful, please provide me with feedback by leaving a comment in the relevant place or contacting me via IRC or by email.

Thanks and Enjoy!
