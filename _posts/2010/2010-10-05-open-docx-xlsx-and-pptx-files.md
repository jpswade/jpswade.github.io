If you've been sent a file with the extension **.docx, .xlsx or .pptx** and you don't have the latest version of Office then you'll share the frustration that many users have experienced.

> Windows cannot open this file: _document.docx_

Find out how to get around this problem&#8230;

<!--more-->

There's a few choices:

  * Get the creator to [save the file](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/word-help/save-a-file-HP001233033.aspx) in the 2003 file format. For example in Word, you would select a Word 2003 Document (.doc)
  * Use a file conversation tool such as [zamzar.com](http://www.zamzar.com/) to convert the file for you. For example, from document.docx to document.doc.
  * **Download the [Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)** &#8211; Open, edit, and save documents, workbooks, and presentations in the Open XML file formats, which were introduced to Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint beginning with Office 2007 and continuing with Office 2010.Â  (Recommended)

You don't need to do all three. Just pick the one that's right for you. If you're unsure, just download and install the compatibility pack as that will give you the best overall support.

Hope this helps.

Enjoy!
