I'm always coming across new viruses that haven't even been added to the latest anti-virus software.

If I download a file that I suspect is a virus, the first thing I will do is check it against my internal scanner.

If that doesn't detect it as a virus, the next obvious step is to check with a third party virus scanner. I use [VirusTotal](http://www.virustotal.com/) as it checks against about 40 anti-virus engines.

Once you've established that it might be a virus, how do you report it?
