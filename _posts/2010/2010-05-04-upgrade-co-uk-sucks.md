<p class="lead">
  I've been trying to get a quote for a part for a Dell laptop, when I contacted Dell UK, they told me to contact &#8220;Upgrade Options&#8221;. They offered no other alternative.
</p>

I've tried emailing them&#8230;

<!--more-->

> <sales@upgrade.co.uk>

**No response.**

I've tried using their &#8220;online quote request&#8221;

> &#8220;please fill in the form below for a competitive quote&#8221;
> 
> <http://www.upgrade.co.uk/quotes.asp>

**No response.**

I've tried emailing a contact I already had:

> [Alex Holden <alexh@upgrade.co.uk>](mailto:alexh@upgrade.co.uk)

**It failed.**

I've tried emailing another email address listed on their site:

> <busisales@upgrade.co.uk>

**No response.**

Their website is difficult to reach:

> <http://upgrade.co.uk>

**Server not found**

Even when you do reach their website, it looks pants and is difficult to navigate.

**Pants**

To further add insult to injury: All the phone numbers on their website are 0871 numbers charged at 10p per minute:

> 0871 231 1900
> 
> * Please note calls to this number will cost 10 pence per minute from BT landlines, calls from other networks and mobiles may vary. Calls may be recorded for training and quality purposes
> 
> Call Now For Dell Spares and Dell Upgrades &#8211; 0871 231 1924

**I'm going to** [**say no**](http://www.saynoto0870.com/)

They seem to leave me with only one option, which is to open a credit account with them:

> <a href="http://www.upgrade.co.uk/creditappform.pdf" target="new">Click here</a> to open the credit application form, please then fill in all the details on the form, print it, sign it and fax it along with two trade references to 0871 231 1921. If you have any problems or queries, please call on 0871 231 1900.

**No thanks**

Will anyone ever get back to me?

I have hardware needs, but don't appear to be getting any help&#8230;

I did however manage to find an alternative phone number&#8230;

**Success, the number works. Press 1 for sales&#8230;
  
** 

Just in case you missed it, that's

> ## **01252 797660**

Enjoy!****

**Update**

It turns out that emailing _isales@upgrade.co.uk_ gets a response within 24 hours. ****Jack Bodian <jackb@upgrade.co.uk> was kind enough to get back to me with a non-answer, but a response all the same.
