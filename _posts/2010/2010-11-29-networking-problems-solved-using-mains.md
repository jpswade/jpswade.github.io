We've all been there. You want to network your computers and devices together around your house.

The problem arises when you realise that hard wiring isn't all that fun and wireless can be unreliable and slow.

_So what's the solution?_ **HomePlug!**

<!--more-->

[HomePlug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePlug) products use your existing household mains circuit as a communications medium for data and media, allowing you to easily extend your Internet access and expand your home network without drilling or making a mess.

You can easily access your network from any electrical power socket in your house and enjoy complete freedom and portability when choosing the location of your home/ office computers, laptops or games consoles. Particularly well suited to old buildings and houses, HomePlug adapters don’t suffer from typical wireless networking obstacles like thick walls and multiple floors.

_It really is that easy… Just Plug In to your network!_

There are currently 2 speeds of [devolo dLAN products](http://tinyurl.com/39squ3x): the **devolo dLAN duo Starter Kit** supports speeds of up to 14Mbp/s – which is perfect for Internet access extension into any room; then there is the devolo dLAN Highspeed Starter Kit which will support up to 85 Mbp/s – perfectly ideal for
  
higher data transfer, and even video streaming across your home network.

You need a minimum of 2x dLAN adapters (Starter Kit) to start a network, however if you have more PCs to connect – then you can additionally purchase the single dLAN duo or Highspeed adapters for each respective
  
computer.

The [entire devolo dLAN product family](http://tinyurl.com/22plmn4) is compatible with the International HomePlug standard and can be flexibly combined to suit your individual requirements. There’s no easier… safer… nor more secure option for home networking!
