  Today I received a phone call from one of my clients who said that they had a BT engineer with them. OK. I thought, what&#8217;s going on here&#8230;
</p>

They then proceeded to ask me &#8220;what do we rank for on google?&#8221;, my response was &#8220;your company name, unless you request otherwise&#8221;.

They then went on to mentioned that &#8220;the man from BT&#8221; can get us listed &#8220;at the top&#8221; of the search engine for &#8220;our keywords&#8221;.

Naturally I reply to this with a sigh, but how they can they go around making such statements? It&#8217;s so unethical to make these kind of claims.

After reading their marketing bumph, I found out what they meant by &#8220;at the top&#8221;. What they are offering is the ability to list as the &#8220;[sponsored links](http://adwords.google.com/select/en_GB/images/adwords_home/b4.gif)&#8221; in search engines, which appear &#8220;at the top&#8221;.

They requested my email address to send me &#8220;further details&#8221; through, below is the marketing email I was sent. I couldn&#8217;t wait to pull it apart.

This isn&#8217;t at all a review of the BT Web Clicks service, in fact i&#8217;ve not used it, it&#8217;s simply an analysis of their marketing blurb.

> BT webclicks is a new service that guarantees as many or as little hits on your website based on your particular need.
  
> Example. Anybody searching search engines such as google yahoo and msn for the specific type of business they need will be presented with a choice of various differenet company&#8217;s. What we guarantee is not just a priority sponsored listing. We absolutely guarantee that we will the will actually click on to your website searching for whatever your key words say about you. Ie car hire chaueffeur driven

**WRONG:** You can&#8217;t guarantee anything you have no control over. You have no control over our websites or any of the search engines. No matter whether you think you do or not, even if you are using [deep packet inspection for targeted advertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection#Targeted_advertising), which is against your privacy policy and thus against the law.

> If we don&#8217;t achieve the level of clicks you want we will give you your money back for the percentage we don&#8217;t achieve. Furthermore we are that confident of our product that we will allow customers to trial the 960 package for 3 months and can terminate the agreement if they are not happy at the end of this period.

**EXPENSIVE:** According to the [BT Web Clicks Prices](http://www.btbroadbandoffice.com/internetapplications/webclicks/prices), you&#8217;re charging between £1 and £15 per month per click. So, 100 clicks in a month could cost you £1,500. Why would I do that when I get get 100 clicks a month for free using organic methods?

> BT Web Clicks &#8211; Search Engine Marketing for Small Businesses Running a small business is hard work, fortunately your Internet Advertising doesn&#8217;t have to be Do you run a small business in your spare time or know someone who does? If so, BT is launching a new service which could help you save time and money.

**WASTE:** of time and money more like. Small businesses are vulnerable, but they&#8217;re right, running a business doesn&#8217;t get any easier, just like huge corporations are going to continue to try and trick you trick you into buying something you don&#8217;t need. If your business is important, spend the time and money doing it yourself, rather than paying BT to do it.

> Internet Advertising is the fastest growing advertising media in the UK, fuelled by the tremendous growth in the use of the Internet. But small and medium sized businesses are missing out on much of this usage because advertising on search engines is complicated and time consuming.****

**NOT ALWAYS BEST:** Just because it&#8217;s the fastest doesn&#8217;t always mean it&#8217;s the best, this is because it&#8217;s very competitive, and just about everyone has some involvement these days. This is why Google have now started using other forms of media including [TV](http://www.google.com/adwords/tvads/), [audio](http://www.google.com/adwords/audioads/) and [print](http://www.google.com/adwords/printads/). Whatever gets results.

> BT Web Clicks is a new Internet Advertising product that helps small and medium businesses by taking away the pain of advertising on search engines, leaving them to concentrate on their business. It offers customers a fixed amount of leads to their website for a fixed monthly fee. It is backed by a guarantee1 that offers them money back for undelivered clicks.

**PAINKILLER:** Yes, using BT Web Clicks is much like using a pain killer, it block the pain, but they don&#8217;t actually give you a solution, and just like pain killers, they wear off after a while, unless you keep paying for them. Instead invest in a consultant who can act on your behalf.

> Setting up a search marketing campaign on the major UK search engines can take up to 30 hours, however, customers placing orders for BT Web Clicks will have our expert team identify the keywords relevant to their business, create the advertising text, and place and manage the adverts on the major search engines including Google, Yahoo and at least 12 other search engines.

**HOW LONG?:** Last time I checked, planning and setting up a search engine marketing campaign should take about 30 minutes, not 30 hours. If choosing relevant keywords, creating advertising text and signing up to [Google Adwords](http://adwords.google.com/) takes 30 hours, you must be stupid.

**GUARANTEED PIECE OF CRAP:** Here&#8217;s how I see it. A guy puts a guarantee on the box &#8217;cause he wants you to fell all warm and toasty inside. But they know all they sold ya was a guaranteed piece of shit. That&#8217;s all it is. Hey, if you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it guaranteed, I will. I got spare time.

> What does this mean for my business?
  
> Getting visitors to your website is the first step in getting a paying customer so promoting your site in the right place is vitally important. Search marketing is a proven way of generating leads directly from both major and local search engines, however getting it right and running a search marketing campaign to generate quality leads can be both time consuming and costly.

> With BT Web Clicks you get the opportunity to use expertly chosen keywords and professionally written advertising copy that are all relevant to your business.
