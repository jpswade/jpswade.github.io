<p class="lead">
  Well, it&#8217;s finally here.
</p>

It&#8217;s been a long time coming but we&#8217;ve finally transitioned to The DeadUseful Project.

The DeadUseful Project is anÂ amalgamation of some useful tools I created for myself, but then developed them for others over a few years.

My goal for this project is to keep my creativity alive and continue to develop my skills, while putting existing projects to work to earn a passive income.

Well, that&#8217;s all for now, but watch out for the new tools.
