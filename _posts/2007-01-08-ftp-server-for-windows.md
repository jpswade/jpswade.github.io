  I have been on the lookout for a decent FTP Deamon/Server that runs on windows. Its not very often that I do require one, but every so often having one does come in handy.
</p>

<!--more-->I have tried the following software:

  * [Serv-U](http://www.serv-u.com/) &#8211; Over the years I have used this quite a few times, I never really liked it, and it costs over $49.95. I&#8217;m going to look on&#8230;
  * [PureFTPD](http://www.pureftpd.org/) &#8211; Although there is a win32 release, its difficult to work with, no easy way to configure your server, it does not run in the background without 3rd party software, even though it does have a tray icon, but all in all its fairly useless &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t even locate the config file. This thing is designed on and for Unix, not Windows, as I found.
  * [warFTPD](http://www.warftp.org/) &#8211; After much clicking around their website, I managed to actually download this software, only to be faced with a load more screens of clicking in the installation. The software installs to places you don&#8217;t want it to, and it asks questions you don&#8217;t really want to answer during installation. I decided to give this one a miss before the installation was complete.
  * [Gene6](http://www.gene6.com/) &#8211; Its good, the trial only lasts 30 days though and it costs over Â£30, I just don&#8217;t think its worth the price. Changing the port was difficult at first, but I figured you needed to add a domain first, and it worked, its a bit of an odd setup, but it worked.
  * [RaidenFTPd](http://www.raidenftpd.com/) &#8211; Costs over $19.95, however it was really really easy to setup. The problem was that the shareware splash screen was so annoying I could not seem to rid of it, it would not let me continue only quit, so I uninstalled it.
  * [guildFTPd](http://www.guildftpd.com/) &#8211; This one was yet another dirty piece of software, hard to use and navigate, so much so you need to read their guide on it. I could not figure out how to change the port from 21 to another port. However it does turn out to uninstall very quickly and easily.
  * [BPFTPd](http://www.bpftpserver.com/) &#8211; Apparently its based on the old Gene6, it has a 15 day trial. Costs $34.95.

&#8230;and after all that I still have not got a decent FTP server for windows.
