<p class="lead">
  I get asked quite often if I know how to get a mobile phone unlocked, so this is my experience&#8230;
</p>

I was given a Motorola V525 as the original owner had an upgrade. They are on the vodafone network, and I am on O2.

When I put an O2 simcard in the phone it asked me to &#8220;Enter Subsidy Password&#8221; (other phones may say &#8220;Enter Special Code&#8221;), I tried a few random numbers (probably about 15 by the time I had finished), and the phone locked up. Displaying the following: &#8220;Contact Service Provider&#8221;, and it will not go away.

However, there is a solution I found at: <http://www.gsm-unlock.com/unlock/unlock-motorola.html>

> Q: I keep getting the following prompt on my Motorola after I insert another sim card &#8220;Contact Service Provider&#8221; ?
  
> A: That means wrong unlock code has been entered already!
  
> (This message appears after many wrong subsidy or special code entry)
  
> Power on phone and wait between 30 min to 8 hours till Enter Subsidy or Special Code
  
> message appear again! (Please note that phone should be powered on during this time).

I left it turned on, and charging over night, and came to it the following day, it asked me for the unlock code.

After reading [this forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011073831/http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/1/283892) I discovered that you CANNOT unlock the Razr V3, or V525 or any other Motorola simply by providing someone with your IMEI code.

As far as I can see there are only THREE ways around this:
  
1. You need a datacable (~$10) and [MotoPhoenix](http://www.motophoenix.com/moto_unlock.htm) ($25) &#8212; It seems [this guy here](http://web.archive.org/web/20061211113448/http://www.mark-world.tv:80/motorola/manual.pdf) has achieved it using a datacable and some choice software&#8230;
  
2. Contact your phone carrier/operator or service provide (O2, Orange, Vodafone, T-Mobile, etc) and ask them for the unlock code, like [this guy did](http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/2004/04/tmobile_sim_unlock_part_1.html).

They will ask you for the following details:

> Mobile Telephone Number:
  
> Customer Account Number:
  
> Full Name:
  
> Full Address:
  
> Date of Birth:
> 
> Make:
  
> Model:
  
> IMEI:

3. The third way involves using buy methods, such as buying from ebay, gsm-unlock.com or fonefunshop.co.uk, but as these methods are completly untested (by me), and they don't tell you how it works, I wouldn't advise them.

I used method 2, and after a few emails back and forth, and a phone call from the previous owner, I was provided with 2 unlock codes and told that one of them would work.

I have since then used the same method again with Vodafone (ccare.webmails@vf.vodafone.co.uk) for a Motorola V3X, this time I simply put a request for the unlock code, and provided them with the details (as above), within 3 hours I had a reply from them, as follows:

    This worked no problems, so I sent an email back to them congratulating them on their quick response, which makes a change.
