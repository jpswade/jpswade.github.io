When hiring for Team Leads, a common question from recruiters and candidates is, “What’s the difference between a Team
Lead and a Tech Lead?” It’s a good question and one that warrants explanation, especially as, in many companies ‘Tech
Lead’ tends to be one of those titles that is conflated.

In the Push Team, within Core Systems at Bet365, we’ve differentiated and divided the key responsibilities between these
two roles while other teams, other departments and other companies often combine them. For us, we recognise them as two
distinct roles with overlapping and supportive responsibilities and aims, with the key distinction lying in their
primary focus.

### Tech Lead

A Tech Lead, as you might expect, is primarily focused on leading the technology within the team. They are very
technically experienced, having worked across lots of systems and projects, and have become the oracles for systems and
technologies. The primary responsibility is to guide the team in technical matters, helping the team to achieve
successful delivery of quality solutions. Typically, this will remain a hands-on role.

* Technical Expertise – Has a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle, principles and the technologies
used. They are responsible for encouraging best practices, providing support and guidance, as well as understanding new
technologies and trends.
* Architecture – Responsible for the overall design and definition of the system architecture, involved in key technical
decisions and evaluating trade-offs, considering performance, scalability and working towards a solution that provides
the team with a system that is simple and effective.
* Quality Assurance – As a technical lead, you’re responsible for the overall quality of a system or service, and so
there’s often a need to set and enforce quality standards. This means talking to the team about best practices and being
involved in Code Reviews to promote maintainable, scalable code, and adhere to the best practices. Quality is also
achieved through testing practices and code quality checks such as linting or complexity, often these can be written as
code and automated.
* Collaboration – As a tech lead, you’re bridging the gap between the business and the technology, helping to translate
business requirements to the team and vice versa, communicate technical challenges and limitations to the business.

Where the confusion lies, is often Tech Leads also take on Team Lead responsibilities, however for us in a team where
technology is central to what we do, these responsibilities are incredibly time consuming and would leave little time to
be successful at both, so for us, it makes sense to split those roles into two. This is where the Team Lead role comes
in.

### Team Lead

The responsibilities of a Team Lead are centred more around the team dynamic, the people, encouraging and nurturing a
culture of collaboration and cohesion. They are responsible for orchestrating the collective efforts of the team to
achieve their goals efficiently. In terms of code, this role is typically hands-off role.

* People – Team Leads need to have strong interpersonal skills, good communicators and build strong relationships with
team members. It’s about putting people over processes and nurturing a culture of positivity and inclusivity.
* Coordination – They need to good organisation and time-keeping skills, being able to manage multiple workflows and
projects. They need to use their communication skills to keep in touch with stakeholders and provide progress updates.
They need to understand the urgency or timescales and help the team to prioritise and schedule in work.
* Mentoring – Members of the team will often need more interpersonal and career support and guidance; this is where a Team
Lead can help the individuals to developer their skills and tackle challenges.
* Mediation – There can often be competing solutions on a team. As a Team Lead, being less directly involved in the
solution, allows the advantage of being able to have a more neutral perspective, acting as a facilitator to help in
mediating and resolving disputes as they arise.

As you may be able to tell, some of these responsibilities will also be taken on by a Tech Lead, for example, mentoring
where more junior members of the team may need much more specific, technical hands-on guidance and support.

In summary, while Tech Leads typically have the most technical knowledge within the team, Team Leads, though not always
technical as strong as a Tech Lead, recognise the value of understanding the technology. They are adept at comfortably
communicating in technical language with the team and asking pertinent questions.

What this means in practice is, when working on a project to introduce a new feature, a Team Lead often acts as the
coordinator between stakeholders and the team. They grasp priorities, organise work, and manage timelines. Meanwhile, a
Tech Lead plays a critical role in guiding the team in making technical decisions, contributing to system design and
architecture, and ensuring best practices and code quality.

In essence, Team Leads and Tech Leads organise themselves in a way that optimises effective solution delivery,
leveraging their unique strengths to achieve success.
The distinction between a Team Lead and a Tech Lead hinges on their primary areas of focus and key responsibilities.

Tech Leads are technology-centric and are prioritise technical solutions, while Team Leads are people-centric and
prioritise nurturing the team.

So, the next time you encounter the question, "What's the difference between a Team Lead and a Tech Lead?" remember,
it's all about where they focus their expertise and efforts. Tech Leads gravitate toward technology, while Team Leads
focus on getting the best out of the people.
