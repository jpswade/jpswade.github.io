Recently Microsoft have been running a campaign to get rid of their 10-year-old web browser, [Internet Explorer 6](http://www.theie6countdown.com/default.aspx). This got me thinking&#8230;

What about [Outlook Express](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook_Express)? Outlook Express is as old as Internet Explorer 6 and has been included in Internet Explorer since version 4 until version 6.

If Microsoft are advising people to upgrade to a version of Internet Explorer that no longer includes Outlook Express, what are the alternative options?

  * [Microsoft Outlook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Outlook) (Yes, there is a [difference](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257824)) 
      * Pro: Most people have Microsoft Outlook as part of Microsoft Office
      * Pro: Not just mail, it also includes a calendar, task manager, contact manager, note taking, a journal and web browsing
      * Pro: Supports importing messages from Outlook Express
      * Con: It is not free to download like Outlook Express
      * Con: You have to purchase updates by purchasing the latest version of Microsoft Office
      * Con: [It's broken](http://fixoutlook.org/) (Uses Word rendering engine to display HTML emails)
      * Con: Microsoft Outlook cannot view [newsgroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup)
  * [Windows Live Mail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Mail) (Microsoft's official replacement) 
      * Pro: It's free
      * Pro: [It works!](http://www.email-standards.org/clients/windows-live-mail/)
  * [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird) (Open Source) 
      * Pro: It's free
      * Pro: [It works!](http://www.email-standards.org/clients/thunderbird/)
      * Pro: Imports from Outlook Express
      * Con: May be confusing to novice users
  * [Gmail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) (Not really a client, but a reasonable option) 
      * Pro: It's free
      * Pro/Con: It's online

<span>There's a whole bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-mail_clients">other email clients</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_webmail_providers">webmail providers</a>, but these were chosen because they offer something for everyone considering moving away from Outlook Express.</span>

<span>If you're still using Outlook Express, you're using an outdated piece of software with no future.</span>

<span>What with the demise of Internet Explorer 6 and the uptake of new operating systems such as Windows 7, it's time to replace Outlook Express.</span>

<span>What did you choose as your Outlook Express replacement?</span>
