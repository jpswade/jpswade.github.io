Those that have one will be very familiar with the [BT Home Hub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Home_Hub).

As you are probably aware, the latest very is the black sleek look &#8220;BT Home Hub 2.0&#8221; broadband router.

However, some of you that have machines positioned a distance from the hub, where cabling is not an option are probably wondering what wireless adaptor is right for the &#8220;BT Home Hub 2.0&#8221;, and well you&#8217;re not alone.

After taking a look at the manual you&#8217;ll soon discover that the device claims it is compatible with WiFi that is &#8220;802.11b&#8221; and &#8220;802.11g&#8221;.

However, after a bit of further digging around online, I have discovered that the device also supports the newest draft of the Wi-Fi protocol &#8220;802.11n&#8221;.

I soon discovered that the most commonly used, widely used, and cheapest option was the [Belkin N Wireless USB Adaptor](http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(50662)a(1634641)g(16472718)url(http://www.dabs.com/productview.aspx?Quicklinx=4PRDWS)), reporting a huge 110mbps up from 45mbps on the G version.

Sure there are other, more expensive options, but do they really offer that much more in terms of speed? I&#8217;m not convinced.

The Belkin N, N1 and N+ all suggest the Data Transfer Rate is 300Mbps, yet the N1 and N+ cost almost double the price of the N.

Sure the more expensive models may look nicer and support newer drafts of the protocol but ultimately, they don&#8217;t offer any additional speed, especially since this router only supports 802.11n &#8220;draft 1.0&#8221;, and not &#8220;draft 2.0&#8221; anyway.

You could also consider watching some &#8220;howto&#8221; videos on [boosting your wifi adaptor](http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to-wi-fi-booster-for-belkin-n-wireless-usb-adapter/), however you may find you get asked to turn your wok into what looks like a DIY satalite dish.
