  Today I looked into social bookmarking.
</p>

Social bookmarking has been around for quite a while now, it&#8217;s a great way to bookmark your links, and share links with others.

**Sharing your bookmarks**

In the past people have asked me how to go about how to export their bookmarks from their browser.

First of all I would like to say that if you are currently using Internet Explorer, you need to stop, and download a copy of Firefox.

Once firefox is installed you will be asked to follow the setup. At this point you can import your settings (including your favorites) from Internet Explorer. I would recommend this.

Now you have all your bookmarks in one place you can begin to organise them into folders and section them off making it easy to browse them. You can do this by using the &#8220;Bookmark Manager&#8221;, which is located under the file name as Bookmarks -> Manage Bookmarks.

Once you are all organized and ready to go you can simply select File -> Export, which allows you to export all of your bookmarks to a HTML document, which you can then use to share with others to send via email or place on your website.

Its also useful if you like to clear out your bookmarks every so often but keep that as a backup.

It could be also be useful to know that there are website bookmarking services known as [Social bookmarking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking "Social bookmarking") available which allow you to access your bookmarks from anywhere in the world. Probably the most popular is [del.icio.us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del.icio.us "Del.icio.us"), or perhaps [Furl](http://www.furl.net/ "http://www.furl.net/")<span class="external text">,</span> check them out, they are free to use.

I also do recommend taking a look at [Google Bookmarks](http://www.google.com/bookmarks) and if you use Firefox, take a look at the [GMarks plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/gmarks/).

**Making your blog more socialable**

After spending some time looking for &#8220;social bookmarking&#8221; scripts for wordpress, I discovered that there really is just one real option out there.
