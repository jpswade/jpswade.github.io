<p class="lead">
  Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hm2k">assisting the creation</a> of articles regarding icon software on Wikipedia.
</p>

It started when I helped improve an article on &#8220;[Icon Editors](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Icon_editor&oldid=298521785)&#8220;, but because it lacked notability on its own, it was merged with the parent &#8220;[Computer icon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_icon)&#8221; article.<!--more-->

The list of &#8220;Icon Editor Software&#8221; then became a &#8220;[List of icon software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_icon_software)&#8220;.

So far, the list contains: [@icon sushi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/@icon_sushi), [Axialis IconWorkshop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axialis_IconWorkshop), [Greenfish Icon Editor Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfish_Icon_Editor_Pro), [IcoFX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IcoFX), [IconBuilder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IconBuilder), [IconEdit2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IconEdit2), [Microangelo Toolset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microangelo_Toolset) and [RealWorld Icon Editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealWorld_Icon_Editor).

My favorite icon software for Windows is _Microangelo Toolset_, but since this is expensive, I&#8217;d probably likely use a freeware alternative such as _IcoFX_, since there&#8217;s no decent open source [alternative yet](http://alternativeto.net/desktop/microangelo-toolset/). However, I have yet to try out @icon sushi and many of the others.

I am looking to expand the list, so if you know anything about icon software and can provide notability (such as a professional written review or tutorial) for it, that would be very useful.

The best reference for icon software I could find was an article called &#8220;[Create your own icons](http://www.officialwindowsmagazine.com/4352741769176146053/create-your-own-icons.html)&#8221; written by Karl Hodge (who often writes for one of my favorite magazines &#8211; [.net magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.net_%28magazine%29)).

Although contributing to Wikipedia is satisfying, I can&#8217;t help but think that I&#8217;ve wasted far too much time on this, and I wouldn&#8217;t like to think my efforts are totally futile so perhaps one day an online magazine such as [SmashingMagazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) will use it as a base to review of all the popular icon software out there or perhaps even credit me for the content suggestion and it will have all been worth while.
