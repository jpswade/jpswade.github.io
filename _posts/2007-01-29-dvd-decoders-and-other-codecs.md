  Possibly one of the most annoying and confusing issues on windows is dealing with and understanding which codecs you need to do what.
</p>

There are a number of solutions to ensure all of your music, videos and other media will play on your version of windows.

I&#8217;ve recently experienced a problem where Windows Media Center returns a decoder error.

This was stopping me from setting up the audio within the wizard, so the plan of action was to locate an [all in one codec pack](http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Codec_Pack_All_in_1.htm) which then meant I didn&#8217;t have to worry about which codecs I need to do what, it just includes them all, or so I thought.

Okay, so the codec pack got the sound working, great. However when I come to play DVD&#8217;s there&#8217;s a decoder error yet again, which means I require DVD decoder software.

There are a few options with this&#8230;

  * Purchase the software](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/getmore/plugins.aspx#DVDDecoder) 
  * Purchase or download and try for 30 days the [nVidia PureVideo Decoder](http://www.nvidia.com/object/dvd_decoder.html) &#8211; it would match the chipset
  * Purchase [InterVideo DVD XPack](http://www.intervideo.com/media_pack/jsp/Product_Profile.jsp?p=DVDXPack) for $14.95
  * Purchase or download and try for 30 days [CyberLink PowerDVD SE](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829160744/http://www.cyberlink.com/winxp_plugin/2006/enu/index.jsp) or v7.0 &#8211; i&#8217;ve used this in the past
  * Purchase the Roxio solution which is [CinePlayer](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121033852/http://www.sonic.com/products/consumer/cineplayer/microsoft/plugins01.aspx) for $14.95 &#8211; never used it, don&#8217;t like roxio
  * Download a free or open source DVD decoder &#8211; near impossible or does not exist

Not to worry though I can use the [Microsoft Windows XP Video Decoder Checkup Utility](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=DE1491AC-0AB6-4990-943D-627E6ADE9FCB&displaylang=en) to make sure any I do choose is compatible.

To be fair although it should be a crime to have to pay to watch DVDs on your computer considering you have purchased a piece of hardware that is essentially a DVD reader, you do still need a DVD player, and $14.95 (just over Â£8) is not a bad price for a legit piece of DVD playing software, and its a damn sight cheaper than purchasing a separate DVD player unit to do the same job.

However, more often than not, if you purchase your PC from a large retailer, or you purchase a retail optical drive, you will receive a copy of one of the Microsoft approved DVD decoders listed above, so it might be worth considering that before you make your next purchase.

Yet with all that in mind, I&#8217;m still looking for that free or open source DVD decoder that will work with Windows Media Center or approved by Microsoft. We can all dream can&#8217;t we?

You may ALSO require [DivX](http://www.divx.com/divx/download/), [QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html) and [Real Player](http://www.real.com/freeplayer/) (or their alternatives) to name a few to play certain types of videos, and I would also suggest taking a look at [Winamp](http://web.archive.org/web/20091214100539/http://www.winamp.com:80/player/free.php) if you haven&#8217;t got it already as its a brilliant piece of software for playing music and video clips.

Additional Notes: Recently I have been looking at both [VideoLan&#8217;s VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) and [Media Player Classic](http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli/) which are either free or open source alternatives. I&#8217;ve yet to test their ability to play DVDs, how compatible they are with different video types or how other software (such as browsers and other media players) utilise their codecs.
