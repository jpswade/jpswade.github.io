  Are you a technology enthusiast? An engineer? Perhaps you’re a creative mind or just like making things?
</p>

## Well, here’s something for you!

There are [hackspaces all around the world](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) and now there’s one in The Potteries.

A [hackspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) is a place for people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.

We’re a group of technology enthusiasts, engineers and creative minds that have started meeting on a regular basis in an effort to collaborate on various projects.

As a group, [Potteries Hackspace](http://www.potterieshackspace.org.uk/) has been seeking a place to meet since it formed in 2010.

Now, thanks to [Randles (Garages) Ltd](http://www.randles.co.uk/), the group are holding open meetings every Tuesday at 7PM at the disused site in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. You’ll find us in the old valeting bay of the former car dealership.

Whether you’ve got a project you want to stuck in with, or even if you haven’t, anyone is welcome to come down and have a brew.

It’s free to come along, there’s no obligation to donate but it is encouraged.

**What are you going to make?**
