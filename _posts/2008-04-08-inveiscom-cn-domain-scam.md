Upon closer inspection I realise they don't specify the domain extension, I visited their website to investigate further. Their main page contains statistical information about .cn domain names, which is the ccTLD for China.

It's a nice idea, it looks like a legit email, and it plays on trademark law, which states that you MUST defend your trademark in order to maintain it.

However, the first thing I notice as odd is the , they use in the email address, then the fact they didn't specify the domain these people are trying to register, and I've never heard of them.

A quick google of &#8220;Inveis.com&#8221; finds a blog post entitled &#8220;[Domains scam](http://www.mufaka.com/post/2008/03/Domain-scam.aspx)&#8220;.

Apparently, they will register your domain under .cn and try to sell it back to you if you respond with any concerns over your domain name.
