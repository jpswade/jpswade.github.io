  The thing that has been bothering me recently most of all, even more than online spam and junk mail, are telemarketing calls. I recently had an increase of unwanted telemarketing/telesales calls.
</p>

So I went stright onto the BT website, and went to their contact [phone numbers list](https://www.bt.com/feedback/feedback.jsp?formid=contactus_phonelist), I then called the &#8220;Malicious Calls&#8221; number on 0800 661 441.

They advised me to call two numbers, the first was [BT Privacy at Home Service](http://www.bt.com/btprivacy/) on 0800 121 8000. They told me to first signup to the Caller Display service (which is completly free, and takes about 24 hours to become active), and to register with the [Telephone Preference Service](http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/) (TPS), you can also choose if you want BT to call or not (I chose no).

You can also register with the Silent Call Guard on 0870 4443969 registration is free, lasts for one year and takes no more than 28 days to become effective.

Although I HAVE signed up to all these services, I have to wait 28 days for anything to happen so I am STILL getting calls.

**Did you know?**

  * Most telemarketing companies use a tactic called &#8220;predictive-dialing&#8221;. Basically what this means is that their computer auto-dials your number, assuming it will take you about 2 rings to pick up, before switching you over to the next available telemarketer when you do pickup, so as not to waste the telemarketers&#8217; time while waiting for you to pick up, after all, time is money to them.
  * Due to &#8220;predictive-dialing&#8221; if there are no availible telemarketers, the computer will hang up.
  * Also due to predictive-dialing, you get a delay before someone says anything, apparently often they wait until you say &#8220;hello&#8221; twice before they pickup, therefore DO NOT say &#8220;hello&#8221; twice, as dialers register a single hello as an invalid number.
  * Finally, when you suspect you are getting one of these calls (usually calling from an unknown or withheld number) simply pickup, and do not say anything, if you hold on the line, you may eventually hear a message that is designed for answering machines explaining that you have received a call from whoever is calling.

So I have decided to take matters into my own hands, the following list is simply a collection of things you can do while you wait for these services to come into action.

  * Ask the caller to remove you from their database and put you on their &#8220;DO NOT CALL&#8221; list.
  * You can report the caller to [UK Data IT](http://web.archive.org/web/20111222041725/http://www.ukdatait.co.uk:80/cgi-bin/report.htm) who will research it for you.
