  Some people find it difficult to get to grips with marketing concepts, so here&#8217;s some real life examples to get you started.

  * You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m fantastic in bed.&#8221; &#8212; That&#8217;s direct marketing.
  * You&#8217;re at a party with a bunch of friends and see a gorgeous girl. One of your friends goes up to her and pointing at you says, &#8220;He&#8217;s fantastic in bed.&#8221; &#8212; That&#8217;s advertising.
  * You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and get her telephone number. The next day you call and say, &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m fantastic in bed.&#8221; &#8212; That&#8217;s telemarketing.
  * You&#8217;re at a party and see a gorgeous girl. You get up and straighten your tie; you walk up to her and pour her a drink. You open the door for her, pick up her bag after she drops it, offer her a ride, and then say, &#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m fantastic in bed.&#8221; &#8212; That&#8217;s public relations.
  * You&#8217;re at a party and see a gorgeous girl. She walks up to you and says, &#8220;I hear you&#8217;re fantastic in bed.&#8221; &#8212; That? That&#8217;s brand recognition.

Now go get her, tiger!

**Update:**

  * You&#8217;re at a party and see a gorgeous girl. You talk her into going home with your friend. &#8212; That&#8217;s a sales rep.
  * Your friend can&#8217;t satisfy her so he calls you. &#8212; That&#8217;s Technical Support.
  * You&#8217;re on your way to a party when you realize that there could be gorgeous women in all the houses you&#8217;re passing. So you climb onto the roof of one situated in the middle and shout at the top of your voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m fantastic in bed!&#8221;. &#8212; That&#8217;s Spam.
  * You hear about women like this but never meet one. &#8212; That&#8217;s false advertising.
