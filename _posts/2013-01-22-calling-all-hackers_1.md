Are you a technology enthusiast? An engineer? Perhaps you’re a creative mind or just like making things?
Well, here’s something for you!

There are hackspaces all around the world and now there’s one in The Potteries.A hackspace is a place for people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.We’re a group of technology enthusiasts, engineers and creative minds that have started meeting on a regular basis in an effort to collaborate on various projects.As a group, Potteries Hackspace has been seeking a place to meet since it formed in 2010.Now, thanks to Randles (Garages) Ltd, the group are holding open meetings every Tuesday at 7PM at the disused site in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. You’ll find us in the old valeting bay of the former car dealership.Whether you’ve got a project you want to stuck in with, or even if you haven’t, anyone is welcome to come down and have a brew.It’s free to come along, there’s no obligation to donate but it is encouraged.What are you going to make?Find out more, visit: potterieshackspace.org
