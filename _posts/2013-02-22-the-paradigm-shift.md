The next &#8220;computer&#8221; you buy will be a paradigm shift, a change in the way of thinking.

We&#8217;re already at a point where we can have a paperless office. The ability to scan to a searchable PDF combined with the ability to print to a PDF file and email, as well as &#8220;the cloud&#8221; providing instant online backup all means that there&#8217;s no longer any need to print a paper copy.

The web is changing into something that is no longer a case of &#8220;mobile web&#8221; or normal web, it&#8217;s all about responsive design, one web that will work on any device.

Mobile internet devices such as smart phones and Tablet PCs are cutting a huge slice of the internet pie, estimating a 50% share by next year. We&#8217;re no longer going to be found sat in front of our PCs pulling our hair out as we plod through trying to make them work for us. Rather than an &#8220;everything machine&#8221;, computers will become the tools we intended them to be, to get the job done.

I&#8217;ve a very clear vision of the future of IT. If you haven&#8217;t already, it&#8217;s time to let go of the artefacts of the past and embrace this paradigm shift.

We&#8217;re not just talking about in the home either, large corporations such as [Barclays are already embracing this shift](http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/barclays-cloud-open-source-103349) by ditching the status quo and utilising modern technologies.

Modern browser technology effectively gives us the operating system independence we&#8217;ve been waiting for, our databases are in &#8220;the cloud&#8221; and so are our files and emails. There&#8217;s no need for the bulky archaic in-house windows servers to power expensive windows systems, no, instead any device that has a web browser will do.

It&#8217;s only a matter of time before more companies realise not only the potential of the technology, but the savings that can be made and it&#8217;s only a matter of time before this happens at your company too. It&#8217;s no longer a question of &#8220;if&#8221; this will happen, it&#8217;s a question of when.

We&#8217;re already seeing evidence of this in the faster moving home market. The introduction of services such as Netflix has resulted in a drop in physical DVD sales. HMV has gone into administration, as has Blockbuster rentals, not to forget Rakuten owned Play.com which is set to become a Netflix competitor instead of selling physical products directly to consumers.

It&#8217;s clear that what people want these days is &#8220;all you can eat&#8221; services that can be accessed on whatever device you can get their hands on. Sure, there&#8217;s still going to a market for physical products, but it&#8217;s very quickly going to become a small minority of people who aren&#8217;t yet quite ready to embrace new technology and still cling on to the past through materialism.

As fresh blood comes into your business they will be wondering why you&#8217;re clinging onto these decade old systems, ready to embrace modern technology they will jump at the chance to use a tablet and once existing staff members see them and understand the benefits, they too will begin to embrace this change.

This technology that was dreamed up in the 1960s, which started to come into fruition in the 1970s, were implemented in the 1980s, have developed through the 1990s and 2000s are finally here.

It&#8217;s 2013, buy a tablet.
