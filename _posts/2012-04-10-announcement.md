As of April 2012, I have agreed to enter into full time employment, initially for 12 months with a company very close to my heart that has been demanding my expertise more and more:RandlesThe Randles Motor Group is a fast expanding, family business that already has Peugeot and Suzuki dealerships in Stoke and Stafford, with more to follow.I’ll be joining my mum & dad, my sister & brother-in-law in the company to support the demands of further growth as the group IT manager.Not only will I be expanding the existing IT infrastructure, but will be putting much needed IT network administration in place and leading the development of a new group website.What this means for:DevotedITUnfortunately some opportunities to expand the business did not come to light and I have made a decision to begin winding down the business.I will honour any existing support agreements as best as I can until their natural end. Any ongoing services such as broadband or hosting will be transferred to another supplier.For now, I will also continue to take bookings for small jobs on an “as and when” basis, to be carried out on evenings or at weekends. Special arrangements can be made for “urgent” issues.PhurixI will still remain involved in the business as a partner but all day to day operations have been transferred to my business partner, James Henry.James Henry has agreed to continue to drive the business forward and supports the decision I have made.Phurix customers should continue to use the regular communication methods. Should you contact me directly about Phurix, please appreciate that I may not be able to get back to you as quickly as you’d hope.Other projectsMost other projects (code, forums, blogs, single purpose websites, etc) should continue to run as normal without much interaction from me. However, please appreciate that I may have less time to contribute to them.I have considered reducing the amount of intellectual property I own and online real estate I manage, but no changes are planned at the moment. Announcements will be made if any changes are planned.MeThe reason I have decided to do this is because it’s the right time. As Randles grows, I want to be more involved to ensure that they are making the most of their IT.My goal as Randles Motor Group IT manager will be to increase sales by developing a new website and increase productivity by improving the IT infrastructure.Taking this job has in no way been an easy choice, but it will give me the opportunity to really apply myself and allow me time to step back from everything else while I plan my next move.YouHopefully you will continue to support me and can understand why I have made this decision.If you have any questions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to contact me.- James Wade
