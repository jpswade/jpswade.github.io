<p class="lead">
  For those that don&#8217;t know&#8230; <a href="http://www.mirc.co.uk/">mIRC</a> is communication software, otherwise known as an IRC client. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC (or Internet Relay Chat)</a> to me is a place where people can come together to discuss a shared interest to form a community.
</p>

To be a part of these communities is very rewarding in essence that by networking with people you can get involved in things you wouldn&#8217;t normally be involved in, while also having the ability to seek advise or help others. The scope of IRC goes far beyond this.

I use mIRC on a daily basis to communicate with friends in these communities, I also use it as a scripting platform for many things from returning the exchange rate to locating a site via google to checking if a domain is taken. The possibilities are endless.

In light of the release of mIRC 6.3 (16-Aug-2007), and after [this thread](http://forum.efnet.org/mirc-6-1-released%C7%83-t112.html), I have decided to purchase a license.

This shocked many people as I have been infamously recognised as creating both a keygen in mIRC (regmirc.mrc) and in Eggdrop (regmirc.tcl) for mIRC that will generate a registration key. (Both of which were based on an algorithm by Nitrus).

Spending time as I did in this scene when I was younger was always fun (like anything illegal), and I enjoyed the challenges however as I have gotten older (and wiser) I&#8217;ve mostly left the scene behind.

The scene is a thank-less mess of politics and power hungry nobodies, people with far too much spare time, and no real job. No matter how many times it tries to come back, it&#8217;s always the same.

Back in the day (with the help of tonix) we even wrote a script that would use mIRC to bit write patch the &#8220;mirc.exe&#8221; to remove the CTCP version (which is hardcoded into mIRC and can&#8217;t be disabled):

> //rename mirc.exe x | copy x mirc.exe | bwrite mirc.exe 1441091 x
> 
> Note: This will NOT work on recent versions, this was the correct byte position for an older version of mIRC (I forget which), besides making changes to the &#8220;mirc.exe&#8221; is against their terms, regardless whether you were able to do it from mIRC or not

We also realised the &#8220;bwrite&#8221; (which is a standard function of mIRC) could also be used to patch &#8220;mirc.exe&#8221; to make it accept any name and registration key you entered, however in recent versions a CRC check was introduced that meant making changes to &#8220;mirc.exe&#8221; would cause it to error. The regmirc keygen method always worked, and could be done within mIRC as well.

The algorithm used in the &#8220;regmirc&#8221; keygen has worked since the first public release right up until mIRC 6.3. This is the first release where the serial you enter is verified online. This is not a problem, as even though it is checked, and could come back as invalid, you could still use the software if you wanted to regardless, however you are now faced with a nag screen claiming your trail has expired, to which you must wait for the &#8216;continue&#8217; button to appear use the software.

It almost goes without saying that even the online verification can be bypassed either by doing patching &#8220;mirc.exe&#8221; to over-ride or disable the check or by faking the response from the verification server using your localhost. Both these methods could be written into mIRC as a script.

But why? Here are the reasons why I shouldn&#8217;t:

  * mIRC always has been there and it continues to maintain it&#8217;s position.
  * I&#8217;ve coded many scripts in mIRC and have become quite established in the community.
  * Khaled has replied to all my emails directly so far. He&#8217;s a nice chap.
  * Obviously they&#8217;ve made a concious effort to add the online check for a reason.
  * mIRC has never become unusable after the trial period has ended, although the trial period is only 30 days, you are able to continue to use it beyond that.
  * I am no longer a kid, or a student, I work for a living, I have no excuse.
  * Based on my &#8216;morals of downloading&#8217;, mIRC falls under &#8220;If you like the software and cannot live without it, pay for it&#8221;.
  * I wish to invest into the future of this product.
  * Once it&#8217;s paid for, it&#8217;s paid for, the license will work on all future versions of mIRC.
  * It&#8217;s only $20, due to the weak dollar at the moment, that&#8217;s less than £10, i&#8217;ve spent more than that on domains I don&#8217;t even need.
  * At time of writing, I have been using this copy of mIRC for 1652 days, that’s about 4.5 years.

My $20 has been long over-due.

I have nothing to hide, I have paid my dues and now I&#8217;d like to encourage others to do the same and [register mIRC](http://www.mirc.co.uk/register.html).
