[Ninite](http://ninite.com/) is a very useful tool for making it easy to install software on a computer.

All you need to do to get started is visit the [Ninite](http://ninite.com/) website and select the software you wish to install.

Once you&#8217;re happy with your selection of software, you select the rather large green &#8220;Download&#8221; button to download the installer.

The [Ninite](http://ninite.com/) installer will then automatically download and install the software you have selected from the website.

You can just walk away and let it do it&#8217;s job.

<!--more-->This is all very well, but what software do you need to install? Here&#8217;s the top 10 essential tools to install using ninite&#8230;

  1. Firefox &#8211; You should always have a browser other than Internet Explorer installed on your computer, just in case it stops working.
  2. K-Lite Codecs &#8211; Can&#8217;t get that video to play? You&#8217;ll need this, it&#8217;ll allow your PC to play almost anything.
  3. Office or OpenOffice &#8211; You&#8217;ll need one or the other. If you&#8217;ve not got a Microsoft Office license, you should probably use OpenOffice so that you are able to open, edit and create regular documents.
  4. Adobe PDF Reader or Foxit Reader &#8211; You&#8217;ll need a way to read PDF files at some point. Choose wisely.
  5. Microsoft Security Essentials &#8211; It&#8217;s very important to have anti-virus software installed on your computer. This is free and it&#8217;s provided by Microsoft. (Not for you? I can recommend Avast! Home instead)
  6. Malwarebytes &#8211; Never leave home without it. If your PC becomes infected, this is almost always a sure fire way to get rid of it. If it can&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll need expert help anyway&#8230;
  7. Runtimes &#8211; Flash Player for Internet Explorer and other browsers, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Microsoft .NET, Microsoft Silverlight. Get them all! You&#8217;ll need them at some point.
  8. Dropbox &#8211; An essential backup tool offering you 2GB of free secure online disk space to backup your important documents.
  9. KeePass &#8211; If you must store your passwords somewhere, use this.
 10. FileZilla &#8211; Mostly for the advanced user. If you use FTP then this is an essential. It&#8217;s free, has no ads and is better than any other FTP clients.

This is just a list of what I consider essential software for almost every user. There&#8217;s tuns of other software on there which you may find useful, or may not.

I hope you&#8217;ve found this useful.

Enjoy!
