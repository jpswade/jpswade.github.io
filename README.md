# James Wade's Blog

This is my blog, migrated from [Wordpress to Jekyll](https://wade.be/2016/01/30/welcome-to-jekyll.html).

Based on the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)

### Dependencies

- [Jekyll Install Guide on macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)
- [GitHub Pages Dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/)

### Installing

`bundle install`

### Running

For local use: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Updating

`bundle update jekyll`

### Troubleshooting

`The github-pages gem can't satisfy your Gemfile's dependencies. If you want to use a different Jekyll version or need additional dependencies, consider building Jekyll site with GitHub Actions: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/`

This is a common issue when using the `github-pages` gem. You can try the following steps to resolve it:

**Update your Gemfile**: Ensure that your `Gemfile` specifies the correct version of Jekyll and any other dependencies you need. You can check the [GitHub Pages Dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) for the latest compatible versions.
