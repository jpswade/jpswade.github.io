  <strong>Quick List of SEO Tips</strong>
</p>

  * You must get indexed by the search engines, most offer a method to submit your site, however its FAR better to simply get a linkback from another website. Let them find you naturally.
  * Keep the text between the title tags under 60 chrs &#8211; This will help you get the most out of your keywords [Google tails off titles on the serps at about 60 chrs]
  * Avoid using dynamic URLs (eg: http://www.example.com/index.php?id=123) use static looking links instead (eg: http://www.example.com/example-articles.html) &#8212; Also avoid PHP session IDs and unnecessary variables.
  * If your site has multiple (sub)domains, and they have the same content, point them to one domain.
  * Register your domains for longer than a year &#8211; spammers usually only buy domains for 1 or 2 years.
  * Larger, older sites are better, as they score high in search engines.
  * In search engines &#8220;the-word&#8221; usually registers as &#8220;the word&#8221;, so where possible use &#8211; (dash) instead of _ (underscore) in your URLs
  * Choose a domain that will be most relevant to you, either your name (product, company, business, etc) or descriptive (eg: search-engine-optimisation-example.com)
  * Dashes in URL (eg: http://www.search-engine-optimisation-example.com/the-home-page.html) &#8212; stick to no more than 4 in a URL.
  * Keep your URLs short, less than 100 chrs is best.
  * Unique description meta tags per page &#8211; less than 200 chrs, although search engines don&#8217;t rely on this, it is often displayed
  * Unique keyword meta tags per page &#8211; less than 10 words, the keywords must appear on the body text of the page, no repeats
  * Make use of the header tags (H1, H2, H3) these will help identify what the page is and push your page further to the top
  * Place your keywords in your body text near the top, try and use b (bold), strong (bold) or em (italics) on them.
  * By internet standards all images must have alt text &#8211; Describe the image using short relevant text.
  * Use keywords for your link anchor text instead of using &#8220;click here&#8221; or such.
  * External links per page should be a limited to 100 where possible.
  * Choose your domain name TLD extension carefully, .edu and .org appear to get higher status than .com due to spam.
  * Size of pages should not be larger than 100K, its preferred that you have lots of smaller pages.
  * Search engines like updated pages, such as news pages, it also like additional pages, make sure you also keep your old static pages.
  * Site consistency &#8212; although its not proven to be a factor of SEO, it does help usability.
  * Search engines like blog sites as they bare lots of content and many external links, showing trends
  * Use text instead of images where possible. If you have to use images, use alt text. &#8211; Search engines don&#8217;t read text on images.
  * Get listed in directories such as DMOZ and Yahoo, avoid link farms and FFAs.
  * Avoid using meta redirect to redirect users to other pages.
  * Avoid excessive cross-linking to sites hosted on the same IP range (C class).
  * DO NOT copy your content. Not only does this violate copyright laws, search engines penalise you.
  * Search engines find it difficult to get relevant text from Flash if any at all, avoid constructing your page with flash, unless its for presentational purposes.
  * Search engines don&#8217;t follow links in forms, image mapping, javascript links, frames, very well, if not, not at all.
  * Avoid putting your email address in text form on a page, as this will appear in search engines and generate unwanted emails
  * Avoid any &#8220;black hat&#8221; SEO methods, they don&#8217;t work in the long run, stick at the real methods and you&#8217;ll get far better results than risk your site getting banned.
  * Use correct HTML markup where possible, although this doesn&#8217;t make much of a difference to the search engines, it will help you avoid other problems.
  * Don&#8217;t use gateway pages or intro pages, they are useless and tend to disappear from search engines, not only that but the main page gets pushed down. &#8212; This is also bad for usability as visitors aren&#8217;t interested in your gateway, just your website.
  * Try and get as many backlinks from as many reliant websites as possible. Avoid bad sites. &#8212; Anchor text on your links is important here, make sure you use a relevant keyword.
  * Try and get people to stay on your site, avoid annoying the user and provide them with reasons to stick around.
  * Suggest the user bookmarks your page or create pages that would be bookmark worthy.
  * Use a stable web server, there is nothing worse than having your site down.
